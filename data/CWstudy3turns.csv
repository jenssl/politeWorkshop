"Hello again! I wanted to know if you could tell me more about this sugar bowl so I can get a better understanding of what prices it so high!

"Absolutely.  It's from a very well known painter from the 18th century.  As I mentioned to you before, bowls like this typically sell for $600 but can go for as much as $800. Of course, I understand that $800 is a steep price especially for someone who may just be curating their first collection in these items but unfortunately $250 is WELL below its value and I have offers from other buyers above that price.  I think we can find a price that will work out for both of us - I would suggest a slight discount to typical market prices, $580. ",87,"BJJ9K"," 4:48:17 PM "," Seller ","NU5PS",5,1
"Thank you for the information and the consideration! A bowl such as this does sound like it would be quite the piece to own. However $580 is still quite the jump for me.

"Oh, I'm sorry! I hadn't been clear enough. I could pay $350. ",87,"NU5PS"," 4:51:31 PM "," Buyer Nice ","BJJ9K",8,0
"I'm sorry as well, I understand that you revised your offer to $350 but that doesn't seem to quite settle the matter.  You're asking to buy a piece for an almost 50% discount to market value! ",87,"BJJ9K"," 4:52:10 PM "," Seller ","NU5PS",9,1
"I very much understand that. I had hoped that the possibility of  being able to sell the item and get it off your hands would be a plus. Would $400 be more reasonable? ",87,"NU5PS"," 4:53:07 PM "," Buyer Nice ","BJJ9K",10,0
"That is definitely a step in the right direction.  Given how late in the day it is - I would agree to sell the item to you at $450 - this still represents a $150 discount to market prices! ",87,"BJJ9K"," 4:53:40 PM "," Seller ","NU5PS",11,1
