What is it specifically that needs to be ""reined in""?  The public sector unions ensure adequate wages, benefits, and working conditions for the employee.  How is this a bad thing?  They encourage employees to ""BARGAIN"" for these factors.  They are not forced upon the employer.    Much of the frustration from those who are angry with the unions have either misplaced their anger or failed to understand the full complexities of their argument. 1) Overtime cost less than the fully burden rate of a full time equivalent (usually by about 15%) ""fiscally sustainable"" - that depends on the hiring body, but if that statement is true, than the unions should help work on solutions and not demands   2) public work and private work is completely different and should not be compare.  The work is different  3) disagree  4)disagree - old info . Adequate based on an industry standard measured at a bargaining table that includes comparative analysis...  Working Conditions - what are the examples? Working conditions at google/apple far exceed most public sector jobs.  Public sector hours of operation and in the trench work is not typical in the private.

Collective   . running out of time :-)  I agree, some unions have not worked on solutions, but many have.  Private is based on profit and the employees reap extra benefits (monetarily or gifts) of of those profits. Public work is based on the public good and no benefits outside of contractual are gained.

The media has reported several high-level incidents that the public should be aware of.  However, the media does not accurately portray the positive impact that police has with minorities.    The police have made tremendous strides in terms of community engagement with minorities in this country, but unfortunately, the media has a tendency to focus on only the negatives and when they do so, the public is often times only given a portion of the information - not the entire encounter if it captured on video.    However, there is a lot of work that has to be done by police to re-engage and build the trust back in order to prevail in 21st century policing.  . You raise some valid points that I happen to agree with and understand, especially with your comments about a few bad apples who garner all the negative attention.  But wouldn't you agree that the media and social media have agitated the situation by putting a ""popular"" spin on events in order to influence the general public's opinion.  More often than I care to think of, the media shows a body cam or dash cam video that only shows the conclusion of an event which is often a violent encounter.  Why not show the entire event and let the public make an informed decision.  . Great points.  And that is why police have to take the initiative with a renewed community policing strategies as set forth in President Obama's Commission on 21st century policing. I happen to subscribe to these values and initiatives and I think with a lot of hard work and parternships with the minority communities, trust can be achieved.  I think law enforcement can partner with stakeholders in the minority communities for long term improvement and impact.  One of the main priorities has to reduce the use of force incidents that result in injuries or worse. . Yes, absolutely!  Honest must be a hallmark of any police officer in this country in order to protect and serve - they took an oath and have to live by it.  I think police officers can benefit with additional training to include crisis intervention, dealing with people with mental illnesses, and how to de-escalate an encounter via verbal skills or placing themselves in an strategic advantage where they don't have to resort to physical force especially deadly force.  I think more accountability for their actions in terms of reporting and monitoring - body cams, etc. will be useful in turning this around in the public's perspective. . Well put.  The more transparency and fact-sharing with the community (within the legal limits), the more effective the relationship can heal. Healing takes time and I think if the police and public are patient and continue to ""share notes"" and have an open mind about how to best protect the public, the better the outcome for true change.  There is a sense of urgency however, but it needs to start at the grass roots level like you noted.  I'm optimistic that it's heading in the right direction but much more work needs to be done.

I believe that there is hope for the discontinuation due to some of the latest issues regarding pharmaceutical companies refusing to provide the death ""cocktails"" administered to inmates.  The troubling issue will be seeing the ""work around"" that states will come up with to continue the practice without the  meds.. Unfortunately, children have no vote so they are marginalized and not heard by the politicians making the decisions and allocating the money.  I believe this is the reason that so many of the social service programs to help children are underfunded.  The constituents with the loudest voice get the dollars.

I believe that while the vast majority of police officers are good people who perform a valuable public service, there are a handful of bad apples. Unfortunately, when a ""bad apple"" police officer goes over the line, the consequences for the victim can be deadly i.e. Eric Gardner, killed while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes, teenager in Ferguson who shot, young boy in Cleveland killed by police while playing with a toy gun, man in North Carolina shot and killed while running unarmed from police etc. While these crimes represent a tiny fraction of police/public interactions, the actions of a handful of officers undermines the credibility of all officers and contributes to a significant trust deficit. Particularly with communities of color. Again, not all police . I would agree that the media do tend to over report on the extreme examples. But there are enough examples of police making mistakes that it has moved past the ""isolated incident"" status to more of a pattern of crimes against minorities. I do agree that the better police departments are making tremendous strides towards improving community engagement. I would cite the Salt Lake City Police as a good example. But there is a serious trust deficit. At this point, ANY incident is viewed with suspicion. Police don't get the benefit of the doubt because they haven't earned it with these communities. . I agree that there is a tendency to sensationalize the events and to portray all involved in the worst possible fashion. I do feel that the onus is on the police to be as honest as possible. There are too many examples of officers claiming that a suspect was acting a certain way i.e. threatening them as a justification for use of deadly force. And then, when the evidence comes out (kid in Chicago shot while running in the middle of the street, guy in North Carolina shot while running away after never threatening officer, traffic stop in Cincinnatti where officer fired, guy that was shot while reaching for license live streamed by fiance in car) that now it is hard to believe officers when they claim self defense. I will say they do a dangerous job and there is a need to protect officers but they have to be honest. . I agree. I think we ask police to do a dangerous job and then question the methods by which they keep us safe.  I do think the communities that are dealing the best with this issue are the ones that are reaching out at a grass roots level, making sure they are part of the community, and partnering. If police can build trust and rapport with communities, particularly minority communities, there is more of a cushion for when mistakes happen. And they will happen. But if there is true trust, then communities will be willing to give more benefit of the doubt than they have in the past. Right now many people feel the police are not on their side. If that can change, the entire dynamic can be improved.. I agree with you. Honesty and trust have to be the foundation upon which all interactions are based. The Salt Lake City example I cited earlier can be a model. There has been a focus on training officers to de-escalate situations. They are less likely to use deadly force. I also think that if people were more quick to own up to mistakes, instead of obfuscating or selectively releasing facts, it would help ease the perception that not everyone is being honest. Again, we can't let a small minority of officers ruin the good work of the vast majority of police.",5.88888888888889,4.11111111111111,3.88888888888889,2,3,5,6,5,"Low","Low","High","Low"

I believe that this form of punishment can serve as a deterrent to crime when used appropriately.  There has to be limits on its use however it should be an option for serious violent crimes.  There should be strategies in place with the prosecutors office to use the death penalty as a tool.  Also, society does not need those who have committed such violence against others to be apart of our society.     ","I see your point for sure when it comes to how taking of this life might weigh on the person who has to carry out the sentence.  You are also correct that an ""eye for an eye"" doesn't bring back the other person.  However, I believe that the power of deterrence that the death penalty holds helps to reduce overall violent crimes.  States like Texas or Alabama who use the death penalty all the time have a much lower homicide rate than other states which do not.  ","Life in prison is a deterrent as well however the cost of incarceration in the US has sky rocketed and long term incarnation does little to prevent crime.  As far as convicting someone who is innocent...death penalty cases have many rounds of appeal which allow for multiple chances to prove ones guilt.  However, if we get it wrong just once you are correct that the person would be gone.  I feel that it could be used in just those very extreme cases when evidence is clear and points to just one person. ","I agree with you that it affects a wide circle of associated groups.

We would be better off either doing away with it completely or using it as it was intended.  ","I see your side as well for sure.  Every victim's family handles the event very differently.

I believe that this form of punishment can serve as a deterrent to crime when used appropriately.  There has to be limits on its use however it should be an option for serious violent crimes.

Also, society does not need those who have committed such violence against others to be apart of our society.     . I see your point for sure when it comes to how taking of this life might weigh on the person who has to carry out the sentence.  You are also correct that an ""eye for an eye"" doesn't bring back the other person.  However, I believe that the power of deterrence that the death penalty holds helps to reduce overall violent crimes.  States like Texas or Alabama who use the death penalty all the time have a much lower homicide rate than other states which do not.  . Life in prison is a deterrent as well however the cost of incarceration in the US has sky rocketed and long term incarnation does little to prevent crime.  As far as convicting someone who is innocent...death penalty cases have many rounds of appeal which allow for multiple chances to prove ones guilt.  However, if we get it wrong just once you are correct that the person would be gone.  I feel that it could be used in just those very extreme cases when evidence is clear and points to just one person. . I agree with you that it affects a wide circle of associated groups.  The stats out there aren't great because as a society we have moved away from using this form of punishment.  We would be better off either doing away with it completely or using it as it was intended.  . I see your side as well for sure.  Every victim's family handles the event very differently.

I do not think another death brings relief to the family of the victim.  I am also mindful that a third person has to step in and kill the person who has been convicted and this is bringing that person into a position where they have taken away a life.  This is something which may weigh on their psyche after the event.  . Life in prison is an equal deterrent to persons who are open to persuasion not to kill.  Sometimes society has convicted the wrong person of murder and how can this be corrected if the convicted person is dead? . I accept your point re Texas and Alabama and don't know much about statistics re implementing the death penalty so perhaps the existence of the penalty has reduced violent crime.  I just have reservations about passing the impact of the first crime through society as the implementation of the death penalty affects such a wide circle of associated groups.. i understand your point of view and empathize with anyone who has lost someone to a violent crime.  I guess I just think that following up death with a death creates a cycle that brings more innocent people in to the circle of hurt.  .

It is an outdated practice from centuries ago.  Taking a life for a life will not bring any victim of  murder back. The person who committed the crime has to live with their conscience for the rest of their lives. They lose the gift of freedom as to be convicted of a serious crime like murder means they will spend the rest of thier lives in prison.  Should they not be allowed to suffer the consequences of their actions and conscience.   . I can understand that some crimes can be more heinous than others and one can only imagine the hurt and sadness they cause to the victims family. However, should the perpretrator be allowed time to rehabilitate so that they can or could show remorse for their act.  In other situations,  people have been convicted in the wrong and years later have been relieved of the crime............. Yes that can sometimes be true and in a lot of cases those people without consciences are psychologically and mentally disturbed or challenges.

There is also a possibility (sometimes could be very small) that the person being charged for the crime did not actually commit the crime.  In that case, you run the risk of killing an innocent person.  Lastly, punishment of death is not as strong of a punishment as living the rest of your life thinking about the crime that you committed.  . I would argue that life in prison without the possibility of parole could also be a strong deterrent against doing wrong.

I would also argue that sometimes people act without thinking about the consequences -- like believing that they can get away with it.  In that case, the death penalty does not have any effect.. Society is made up of a group of individuals (human beings).  Either individually or in a group, I don't think it is a right.  Also, I would question whether the panel is an equal representation of everyone in the society.   Appealing gives the opportunity to review the case, which should be available, especially if there is a possibility that someone is innocent.. It's correct that I'm making the assumption of death being an easy option and life is a harder punishment.  I think that is dependent on an individual's view of life and death.

The public reaction has had the benefit of forcing the issues of police misconduct which generations of Americans have experienced with no justice or protection to the forefront of public policy in the country.  Without public pressure and a serious acknowedgement of unqeual protection under the law , these crimes against minority communities would continue to be swept under the rug.   Also, if the situations were not broadcast in everyones living rooms, the general majority public who many times have no experience with these injustices, nor knowlege of how  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere will feel like they dont have a vested interest in developing solutions to the core issues that cause crime (i.e. lack of economic development, race, community distrust etc)  If the instances of police brutality and incarceration were being perpetuated on the majority class there would be no end to the public confrontatio. Media does indeed play a role in raising awarenes and discussion (albeit biased in some instances). It is the American publics responsibility to excersise discernment in the new stories while also not marginalizing the actual experiences of many minority groups in the country. The question becomes, how often do these instances have to occur to be ""isolated"".    Does are imitate life or life imitate art? Media serves as a megaphone... and forces people to confront things and realities from other communities that they wouldnt ordinarily be aware of. Not true... as evidenced by the over 85% representation of Blacks and Latinos in the American penal system.  This is not a new occurence. With the onset of media in the form of cell phones, tablets, street cams, body cams, social media etc I would argue mainstream media is trying to catch up with the raw reality broadcast by ordinary Americans.  The fact is that the penal system and crimes against the minority community now broadcast more then ever force us all to look in the mirror and juxtapose what we "" believe"" America to be in an ideal sense and what it Actually is in many instances for communities who have not had the same media exposure of injustices. The metrics validate my argument. And it is our responsibility as Americans to sift through the BS and good journalistic work in order to see the truth and act on the truth.  The other side of the coin deserve equal consideration. I think the police system serves the most noble of purposes...keeping us all safe.. They should be held in the highest reguard. But they should also be held accountable when a culture exists that fosters injustice towards minority classes..   And we have to ask why crime is most prevalent in minority communities. Strategic divestment, lack of economic opportunity, red- lining in the communities, etc... All of us have a vested interest in fixing the situations... Media helps us keep things on the forefront. . Where you say controversy, I say much needed conversation. All 85% are not there unjustly but justice clearly comes down harder on particular underserved communities. Media will sensationalize for ratings..its only sensationalized if American allow it to sensationalize.. media also informs, exposes, brings awareness to and has to potential to highlight positivity just as much as negativity.. I do not believe these instances and and the reactions are overblown because theyve always been swept under the table. Now we have the ability to catch all of it on camera and the responsibility of knowing it goes on forces us to be on one side of the fence ( help the situation) or the other.

I believe that this form of punishment can serve as a deterrent to crime when used appropriately.  There has to be limits on its use however it should be an option for serious violent crimes.  There should be strategies in place with the prosecutors office to use the death penalty as a tool.  Also, society does not need those who have committed such violence against others to be apart of our society.     . I see your point for sure when it comes to how taking of this life might weigh on the person who has to carry out the sentence.  You are also correct that an ""eye for an eye"" doesn't bring back the other person.  However, I believe that the power of deterrence that the death penalty holds helps to reduce overall violent crimes.  States like Texas or Alabama who use the death penalty all the time have a much lower homicide rate than other states which do not.  . Life in prison is a deterrent as well however the cost of incarceration in the US has sky rocketed and long term incarnation does little to prevent crime.  As far as convicting someone who is innocent...death penalty cases have many rounds of appeal which allow for multiple chances to prove ones guilt.  However, if we get it wrong just once you are correct that the person would be gone.  I feel that it could be used in just those very extreme cases when evidence is clear and points to just one person. . I agree with you that it affects a wide circle of associated groups.  The stats out there aren't great because as a society we have moved away from using this form of punishment.  We would be better off either doing away with it completely or using it as it was intended.  . I see your side as well for sure.  Every victim's family handles the event very differently.  Some push of it and other forgive from the moment the crime occurs.  It is a very tough choice but a part of me still feels that if the option is on books, SOME violent crimes MAY be prevented.

",372,"B64","Public sector unions perform very important functions: (1) they help ensure that any discipline of employees is truly warranted, (2) they bargain for collective salary increases on behalf of all of their members - a well-paid work force is an effective work force and we want effective government, (3) they help collect and bring to management issues regarding the office as a whole.  For example, in State x, they brought to the attention of management the fact that a senior class of workers needed to be created to ensure the effective use and deployment of teams.  Finally, they avoid a politicized work force: that's an important consideration given the patronage system of the 19th century.. Since we are talking ""on balance"" as being within the call of the question, the question is not whether there are abuses but whether they are systemic in nature such that public unions must be reined in.  Public unions have supported the creation of classes in which promotion takes place based on merit; that some may, for example, with public education support tenure does not mean that merit is a foregone loss with unions.  Furthermore, even as to tenure, tenure is important for teaching as it can ensure the longevity of teachers necessary to ensure an effective education and avoid politicization of teachers (and more generally of civil service).  Effective management can effectively discipline public workers in most cases (remember the ""on balance"") by making sure to build an adequate record.. Again, you make a number of generalized charges without support.  Do you have any specific examples of what we are talking about?  And while we are not in the 1920s, do you have any examples that you can point to of where getting rid of unions did not lead to politicization?  I know of examples where there are no public unions and employees can be fired with or without cause.  I can tell you that this does lead to generalized fear on the part of employees, that those offices have problems in recruitment and especially retention - remember we want an experienced civil service, and that there are cases of actions taken for political reasons such as an incoming state official asking for letters of resignation from everyone.  . So is your issue tenure or ""reining"" in public unions more generally?  One can implement a more effective system of discipline in a tenure situation that would work more quickly without ""on balance"" ""reining in"" public unions.  And you talk about good employees being protected, but what about those employees who end up serving a previous political administration well but contribute to work that an incoming political administration does not like?  How can they be sure that they will be protected even with civil service protections - such as what is going on with the current Administration - let alone the previous Administration? You ask me to take your statements on faith with no examples (even general to preserve anonymity) and with there being many historical examples to the contrary.. Well, now you are shifting gears by analogizing government to business.  But with business, are workers really do better when wages are flat, increasingly workers are subject to being treated as independent contractors with almost no benefits, and in fact workers in several industries can't even put together consistent schedules anymore so they can do more than one job and get ahead?  Whether you prefer the ACA or the AHCA, both are designed to address the issue of workers without unions needing health benefits because they have no union to bargain for them.  Now let's shift back to government: I have pointed to many examples of unions performing good functions; you can't even concede one instance in which they have?  Not one?  Anywhere in the U.S.?

You are correct about modern forensic evidence proving innocence.    That is all the reason why we should not abolish the death penalty.   Human Error occurs however I believe there are numerous checks and balances in place to ensure that the defendant is guilty.  In my experience to many guilty people are able to . For some families yes, however as a Tax payer why should I have to help pay $200,000 a year to keep someone alive who has taken the life of someone else.  Again I am talking about the most egregious of crimes.  Evidence and data is collected so much greater now due to technology. If the death penalty deters one murder, than it works.   I believe a lot of the human error is due to the lack of procedure being followed correctly and allowing a guilty person to walk free.  I dont believe the percentage is 5% was innocent the were. Interesting, and that is to bad you had to go through that.  However I have seen the opposite.   Criminals being sentence to long sentences only to get out on parole early and commit the same exact crime that put them in prison.

In my life experience, nothing that human beings touch is even close to perfect.  With this in mind, I do not believe that we as a society have the right to take someone's life.  There have been numerous instances where someone was falsely imprisoned on a life sentence for murder and other serious crimes, and modern forensic evidence such as DNA have later proved to exonerate them.. Life imprisonment also gives closure for families, and is in a lot of ways more of a punishment than death.  Evidence has shown that we as a society, have wrongly convicted people for some very egregious crimes, and have later been found to have been wrong.  . I do not believe that the death penalty is an deterrent to committing murder.  States with the death penalty do not enjoy lower murder rates than states without the death penalty.  Even if the chance of human error is say 5%, I think that is too high to take the risk of killing an innocent person. I  served on a jury before, where the other jurors wanted to hurry up and convict the accused due to his race, and that they had things to do at work, and wanted to go home.  I refused to agree, and kept us there until they changed their minds and issued an acquittal.  The evidence and later arrests proved the man was indeed innocent.  I do not trust people who are randomly selected for juries to make this serious of a decision.  I think life in prison is a just punishment.  . I am sure if it was my son who was brutally murdered, I would want the bastard dead.  That being said, in a moment of clarity, I would not want to be responsible for an innocent person's death, if the facts and evidence somehow ended up being wrong.  Life in prison is good enough.

First, I believe this based on the fact that there have been multiple convictions where an inmate was sentenced to death, then executed and later found to be innocent.   Additionally, there have been multiple occasions in the justice system here in the US where individuals have been convicted, and at the last minute, meaning just before their execution was to be carried out, they were exonerated.   This points to the fact that we have people who are - or come very close - to being put to death by execution in the US where they shouldn't have been up for execution in the first place - and we can certainly imagine there are other cases where individuals are executed wrongly and we never find out because of the dynamics of their given case.   Finally, all studies that I have reviewed do not show the death penalty to be a deterrent to crime, meaning it is not an effective preventative tool to combat ""capital crimes."". I appreciate your suggestion that only criminals convicted of pre-mediated murder and have confessed to the crime and also had all appeals exhausted should be executed.   I recognize that by your providing that framework in which someone could be executed that you're attempting to give them all due process rights and also to make sure that they have confessed to the crime.  However, there are cases in which individuals have confessed to a murder, had all of their due process/appeals rights exhausted, been executed and then found to be innocent.   Therefore, because execution is irreversible and the system for determining who is executed, even as you lay out, is imperfect, I urge you to reconsider.   . Understood on the Boston Marathon; however, I remain concerned that we have an imperfect system, even as you laid it out, for deciding who is executed.   I, too, do not see the benefits of allowing an individual who committed pre-meditated murder to continue living; however, because the process for conviction and determining who is executed is not universally perfect, I remain opposed to the death penalty being used in the US. . It sounds as though you have had a change of heart, correct?  That is, that you are unwilling to have one innocent person serve a death sentence in order to have a specific number of rightly-convicted people executed.   It appears as though you were cut off mid-thought, as your last sentence (and perhaps subsequent sentences) are incomplete... . Very interesting idea to give the convicted the option of being executed.   That sounds appealing; however, I am still concerned that there are people who have been wrongly-convicted and executed, without asserting innocence themselves.  It seems these people are still susceptible to being wrongly executed; rather, they are simply agreeing to die for some reason.     Additionally, someone sentence to death does agree to be executed, which is more costly  than non-execution and the death penalty doesn't deter crime, I wonder what the societal benefit is?    With that said, giving someone the option is not something I've ever thought through thoroughly before, these remain my immediate thoughts which perhaps could be refined, although I doubt it.",540,"B42","Disagree The death penalty in the United States should remain in place for those members of our society who commit the most heinous crimes.   Criminals convicted of murder(s)who have clearly confessed to the crime and would normally receive no chance of parole should be considered for the death penalty after all appeals have been exhausted.   The death penalty should be reserved for only those criminals that have committed premeditated murder.   . I like all your points, however, I'm thinking of the cases like the on e  involving the marathon bombers here in Boston.  I  an't see how it benefits society that the perpetrator of that crime is allowed to remain alive in our society.   I too fear that an innocent person could wrongly be out to death, so the circumstances surrounding the case would have to leave no doubt.  . Your argument is very good.   We all know that no system is perfect and I too would not be willing to have one innocent serve a death sentence for the sake of having a certain number of rightly convicted prisoners put to death.   It appears that at times some murder... Your arguments make many valid points.   I agree with the premise that you can measure a society's progress by the way they treat their prison population.   Taking the life of a murder can be viewed as a cycle of violence kept in motion by the government.   Maybe we could give the convicted the option?? . The death penalty is one of those issues that I am not so passionate about.  I do believe as I have stated the death penalty should be an option in certain cases involving  premeditated acts of violence directed towards individuals i.e/ groups (terrorism).

I understand your position completely and it is in part because of those advances that my  position on the subject has evolved as well. There have just been numerous cases where innocent people have been exonerated. Also, there have been situations where the quality of a person's defense has been largely dependent on the resources that they have to pay for appropriate representation.

Still, the caseload of prosecutors can have an impact on the level of representation.. You're right we do. And I understand your position re: mass murder or a terrorist act.

The underlying issue is can we trust other humans to make a just decision on another person life? The human level of fallibility in decision making and the power that one has to take a life with the death penility don't mix well.

It is very important that people can go to work without being sick from working. Unions are crucial in securing good woorking conditions. In the long run society will benefit from having a fit and healthy workforce. It is waste if a college educated person becomes sick with stress after a few years of work because of poor working conditions.. If rules are fair and clear it should be easy for management to enforce them. Often management fire people without just cause. Unions have a vital role in securing workers rights and that they are not being exploited and fired without a just reason.. I am sure that unions will work with management if there is a clear violation of rules. But often the company has lawyers to twist the case it ways and the union has to represent the employee  who do not have the resources the company has. Therefore unions have to be strongly supportive of the workers. The workers will rarely brake rules - why should they do that?. It has great consequense if a person is fired. Management has an obligation to explain very clearly if rules have been violated. often management fail to document that it has had the necessary meetings with an employee and explained that rules have been violated. Therefore it is essential that unions are brougt in and makes sure that all procedures are being followed and that management properly documents the violations.. Unions work in the interest of all workers and have an important role in protecting the workers. If rules are broken blatantly even the best lawyer won't help. No management often tries to get rid of employees they don't like saying they violate unclear rules, and therefore unions must do all they can to protect the workers rights and strive to improve them and protect them from being exploited.

",362,"B62","Reining in Public sector unions would be an infringement on basic human rights.  Public sector workers have the same rights as  any other worker in our society, and these rights should not be diluted in any manner unless they are also diluted in other sectors as well.  The issue of the power of unions is not applicable solely in the realm of the Public Sector and should not be debated as such.  Unions in our society play a role today that is just as important as the role they played in the past. . The role of the union is not to protect management from itself it is to ensure that basic rights are adhered to for all employees.   Union agreements are bargained between the employer and employees.  no one is holding a gun to either parties head to sign the agreement.   I have always held the belief that if you sign it live it!. Employment is a right and the obligation of the employer to manage properly should not be downloaded onto the employee.  the agreement negotiated is agreed by both parties and needs to be understood prior to signing.  the fact that the employer cannot negotiate an agreement which allows the employer to properly manage issues is not the fault of the union but rather the fault of management.  Again it is not the job of the Union to protect management from itself.. To deal with the mistrust takes open honest and transparent communication.  Well structured contracts build into themselves the ability to deal with this well before negotiations start.  mechanisms such as labor management committees perform this function and is part of the check an balance to ensure issues form both parties are brought forward and the basis for resolution is formed . not sure what you mean by overt masters, however i assume you are speaking of ""Arbitration""  Again it is not the Unions job to protect engagement form itself.    Arbitrators take the case made by each party and apply it to the contract that is written.  In wage settlements arbitration was managements way of avoiding strikes .  again the price to pay for managements inability was to limit the union right.  back to my main point that it is not the unions job to protect management from itself",6.05555555555556,4.88888888888889,5.72222222222222,2,2,5,6,5,"High","High","High","High"

I am not sure about the statement that minorities face a lower level of accountability from some members of law enforcement.  The use of racial profiling seems to indicate higher monitoring and potential for keeping people accountable for actions. I feel empathy for officers who are placed in situations that change second by second and have to make rush judgments. The training they may receive may not have equipped them to respond to a mental health crisis, and it's a lot to ask someone to respond when an individual has active symptoms of illness. Even trained professionals may make incorrect decisions.. I agree with the comment that balanced reporting is important to not overblow situations and stories. There are credible media outlets. And sometimes the challenge is learning the ""truth"" from multiple perspectives. This is a challenge when media has to edit and cut out what won't fit into a teleprompter or a soundbite. It's hard to also know whether individuals interacting with officers are escalating or de-escalating  since we have difficulty taking one another's perspectives when we re in a heated situation, i.e., a pullover for a possible speeding, conduct, or other issue.  . Agreed! And education of those in the media. We each have a responsibility in the process. This is something I have learned in my work and think that it is something we can all be reminded of. There is a trust we place in each other --that officers will help us when there is need for protection and defense, that we as individuals will observe the rules/laws and also acknowledge when we have made mistakes, and that the media will try to also seek out multiple angles and not just the one that sells airtime/ad buys. . With each of the groups we are talking about, media, officers, general public, there are bad apples. We have the tendency to pay attention to the  negative examples and incidents. I think the assertiveness of the media may be warranted when there are situations that seem ""not right"". The grapes analogy is relevant. Media receive feeds from some of the same sources such as AP and Reuters. Some collect information independently. Others rely on secondary sources. I like to think of bad behaviors and not bad people. We can unlearn behaviors or be moved to act differently. ",6.38888888888889,4.44444444444444,5.83333333333333,1,4,5,6,4,"High","Low","High","Low"

Being able to understand how these occurred and how they can be better managed helps all parties. . I agree with your last statement, and from my perspective this adds to the transparency, which I believe ultimately helps things to improve. I support police cameras for that same reason, so there is a balance to the perspectives that get posted to social media. These allow for the discussion to occur, which I believe is a valuable undertaking. At the same time, I acknowledge there are additional pressures on police as a result, in terms of burden of response, that weren't there previously. But I believe this additional burden is part of the responsibility of the police as public servants, to ensure rights are upheld... To your point, there is an issue of media responsibility and ethics; I think 24/7 news coverage feeds to the lowest level of prurient interest and isn't always in the public interest. I can't speak to the copycat effect, but if journalistic ethics were up to par there would be more sifting/winnowing - so maybe we have a mutual enemy!

On one hand I believe that there are some crimes so heinous that the offender should have the ultimate punishment.  However, my primary concern is that an innocent person will be put to death.  With advances in DNA there have been a number of people that have been exonerated from the various crimes.  Also I have heard that the cost associated with those on death row is greater than life in prison due to the numerous appeals.  My position on this topic has been evolving over the years.  I was a staunch advocate but am now having dome concerns as mentioned above.. It actually sounds like we have a similar opinion.   The only exceptions that I could see in lieu of life in prison is where there is indisputable evidence and the crime is so horrible such as a mass murder or terrorist act.  It is cases like the Boston marathon bombing that I would have little sympathy for the offender.  Where so many lives were taken and some many others were forever changed.. I agree especially with your statement on the level of defense.  I believe that there have been some high profile cases where high dollar attorneys have gained an acquittal when in fact the evidence was there to convict. so I think it goes both ways.  There has been a saying that is is better to let 100 criminals go free than to convict one innocent person.   . I am starting to run out of arguments.   I think that as I mentioned earlier that DNA evidence has cleared some that have been previously convicted that it can  also be used appropriately to convict those that are guilty.  Again in the past I was very pro death penalty but am waivering some now.. your comment about ""so help you God"" I  understand.  While I am religious and believe that there is a God.  I don't think that would influence that many to tell the truth especially in todays society.

The Union is in place to facilitate safe and healthy (and equitable) working environment for employees.

I consider myself a pro Union manager but some employees that benefit from lowered standards can have a negative impact on the organization as a whole including members and nonmembers alike.. I agree that regardless of employ all individuals ought have the same level of rights and legal remedies.  However employment is as much a right as it is an obligation to those paying the salary and benefits of the employees.  Unions ought to fight for the benefits and status of their members but not to the extent that the unions requests overcome the ability of the communities to provide for the employees.  There is a duty to provide a safe and meaningful employment to our workers and ensure they are represented.. Concur, completely: if you agree to it you have to honor it.

I believe the Death Penalty should be abolished, however I came to this view only in the past several years. Simply stated I do not believe the State should hold the power to terminate someones life; I base this on the following reasons; The Constitution gurnatees right to life that no man may take that right away, the Government should lead by example (the sanctity of human life) and the Death Penalty is not a just punishment, i.e., two wrongs do not make a right and putting someone to death never ameliorates the crime. . First, this issue shows up in your life whether you acknowledge it or not. The 'power of the State' in this, its most absolute form (the power to end a human life) informs the baseline of morality for issues such as abortion, assisted suicide, wehter a patient has the right to declare a Do Not Resuscitate order. I dont think trust is the issue, I think its a moral issue. I do not agree that War is the 'Death Penalty', war in the true sense is/are participants in combat. . Again, war is not typically a State Sanctioned execution. Yes there is, I believe a fundamental difference. Someone can always choose not to fight (as many on both sides did and have done during every armed conflict in history), not to engage in conflict. However a confined person robbed of their life against any action or will of their own is a vast gulf in action to a willing participant in war. A person must make that value judgement not to fight, but if they choose to do so are we then supposed to let them murder civilians (who choose not to fight) in a humanitarian crisis? That inaction to defend those people is essentially sentencing them to death. . I could not disagree more. I reject Nietzsche and the value or perspective based truth and morality. In your own words if it shifts over time than your argument is only (time) away from irrelevancy and invalidity. It is Machiavellian in that the power of the day sets the rules and manipulation of the weak goes on. Without a set of non-negotiable principles, values and mores, then nothing is taboo, nothing is evil, nothing is off-limits if either enough time passes or the power structure changes the rules.  I reject that in favor of moral absolutes and an absolute truth. . I think we agree on the premise, although I am not sure your existential starting point is rooted in philosophy that you have though out or are taking ownership of with conviction. It is with truth, and only with truth,  that we negotiate reality and handle all of life. I beleive it is not just the end result, but how we arrived there that is crucial.

Marginal employees have no incentive to excel and good employees have no incentive to be good. Both paid same 3 - without unions employee issues would still get addressed through proper channels.  We aren't in the 1920's. We have evolved. Many more laws in place (likely stemming from earlier union actions).

I am not sure about the statement that minorities face a lower level of accountability from some members of law enforcement.  The use of racial profiling seems to indicate higher monitoring and potential for keeping people accountable for actions. I feel empathy for officers who are placed in situations that change second by second and have to make rush judgments. The training they may receive may not have equipped them to respond to a mental health crisis, and it's a lot to ask someone to respond when an individual has active symptoms of illness. Even trained professionals may make incorrect decisions.. I agree with the comment that balanced reporting is important to not overblow situations and stories. There are credible media outlets.

Law enforcement need to do a better job of  policing itself for the betterment of our society and the GOOD cops who do the right thing .  the media is perhaps one of the only unbiased outlet for venting this issue and this issue should not be over looked  .

While sometimes Unions in a public sector setting can delay processes and sometimes protect bad workers, this is an exception not a rule. Public Sector Unions help protect workers from discriminating management (which happens more than should in this day in age), personal vendettas and unsafe working conditions. In a public setting making sure that workers have a collective voice, makes sure that those in power are not the only voices heard by the voters and by the press. . I think it is the place of the union to advocate for the needs of their constituents, is the job of management/elected officials to counter that narrative to the public. While I can agree that sometimes the demands can seem unreasonable, it is then that a clear response is needed. When Unions over step and try to get too much, such as raises, the voters can and have turned against them. This is the reason that while the demands start out as unrealistic but that compromises and contracts are usually negotiated and settled in a very fair and rational way by both sides.  . The problem is that legislation and laws can constantly be changed. Working conditions, workers rights, and what employers can and cannot do can often be changed by state legislatures very quickly. In the public sector, safety risks, especially to firstresponders or those in maintenance often go unregulated and without the union pushing for new equipment or regulations...things like safety goggles and gear for maintenance crews or better breathing apparatus for fire fighters can get ignored. Also discrimination is very real in the workplace and things like progressive discipline protect an employee with the force of law, while employee manuals can be changed at will.  . It doesn't have to be us versus them, but you brought up unrealistic demands. If a union believes that they deserve a 6% raise and the City can only afford 2% or cost of living, there has to be a conversation. Sometimes this conversation spills into the public discourse like anything else in government. In the same way that a citizens group may want a park or more police patrols and the City can either accept this request or explain why it cannot do what the citizens groups request, employees deserve to at least be heard on their demands and the union is a good place for that. In a democracy, especially in local government there are a lot of competing interests and priorities , the unions just represent one of those many interests. . I believe its not as wide spread on the safety angle but when it occurs its very serious. We saw this in NYC with firstresponders to the WTC, they had neither the gear nor protections and their health care was insufficient to cover many of the diseases which this lead to. While this is an extreme example, the public sector unions were advocates to congress to get firstreponder protections/funding through Congress. In addition I have also seen Police Unions lobby for more bullet proof vests etc and better equipment. I also have seen Unions protect against employee discrimination first hand by managers who used their power against them.

We have laws to protect people from physical harms such as assault, and yet we commit the ultimate assault when we take a life as a calculated sanction for behavior.  Unlike other theories of legal punishment, the death penalty has no restorative value for the person subject to it.  And it does not help the victim(s) of that person's crimes.  . The theory that the punishment should fit the crime reduces criminal sanctions to a form of mere retribution.  Other theories of societal consequence or what might be called redemption are negated.  These might include reformation, education and recompense.  None are possible when the defendant is put to death. Retribution also introduces the notion that might makes right and that criminal penalties are a power issue only.. A counterpoint is provided when the families of victims are often quoted in media accounts of sentencing hearings that they have forgiven the defendant.  Or when they say the death of the defendant will not bring back their own loved one.  Many often express sympathy for the families of the defendants.    I believe that there are alternatives which can be implemented with defendants which I are redemptive and constructive.. Retribution is exacting revenge which serves no purpose other than a transactional loss or vengeance.  I believe the concept of ""not enough"" brings up a moral argument that is countered by questioning the morality of taking a life in the first place..

The justice system is not perfect and errors are made throughout the system. Executing a life is not a mistake that can be corrected. Additionally, the death penalty does not deter violent crimes/criminals.  There is greater punishment in locking an offender up for the rest of their life than there is in ending that life. Execution is no different than making the choice to end a life via murder. in both instances a member/members of society are making decisions about when to end a life. It can violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution, particularly in instances where the manner of execution is faulty. . I fully understand your struggle, particularly in cases where children are involved. Often upon hearing particularly heinous stories about abuse of children, my initial reaction is one of ""that person doesn't deserve to live,"" however intellectually I question whether I or the justice system has the right to determine whether someone has a right to live or die. This is particularly true in light of the many cases that are coming to light regarding inaccurate evidence, testimony, etc. . Interesting thought. Do you think the grieved party would be too emotionally connected to the outcome to ensure a fair outcome? I try to put myself in that position and I don't know whether I'd want to be responsible for that if I were a family member. It is not a decision that can be taken back once made. I wonder is death penalty sentencing a jury question or a judge question? . I agree with you regarding people playing God.

",414,"C38","There have been several instances caught on tape where innocent minorities have been shot and in some instances killed. Many police carry their on biases to work with them, like many of us.  The difference is that they are armed with guns and the right to shoot to kill. There are instances when the police in question have had work histories that are questionable.  Infractions of rules, overstepping authority and so forth. Typically those who say it is overblown are not minorities or if they are they are minorities who themselves are police. There seems to be an understanding that it is not an issue is because we have not reached an epic number.  Isn't one innocent person killed too much?. Violence against law enforcement is never the answer.  Compliance with police means very different things depending on the police officer who is asking you to be compliant.  Many people who say comply with police are those who have not been confronted by police continuously.  In some communities there is a distrust of the honesty and integrity of police along with a police's inability to communicate effectively.. I don't feel that the minority community has called for violence against police.  They have called for the police to stop killing innocent people.  (Everyone is innocent until proven guilty)  To make matters worse and even more frustrating for the minority community there are far too many instances where the police who have murdered people, whether by accident or not, are getting off and being found not guilty.  There are bad police and I think when authority goes unchecked and challenged, police seem to think they have even more authority.  I also think, when you keep seeing so many bad things it becomes the norm and you begin to develop your own stereotypes.  Thats no excuse.. The focus should be on those cops who kill.  They should be held accountable by being fired (NOT allowed to retire and collect a pension) and sent to jail for the appropriate sentence.  I don't believe an entire department could operate inappropriately.  I won't begin to talk about the blue brotherhood which runs deep.  Police do not operate in a traditional ""management"" realm with the ""blue brotherhood"" coming first. . Our system does not have checks and balances when the system doesnt work, only the law of karma.  Juries of their peers is a farce and an illusion.  When many people (juries) see a minority that looks a 'certain' way, they draw their own conclusions and create stereotypes.

Public Sector Unions have too much political influence over the government system.  In my experience, what ends up happening is that Unions use their power to either support an elected official or not, and this creates a system where that public official is then ""in debt"" to that Union to ensure they continue to receive their members' votes or must fulfill campaign promises they made to get those votes in the first place.  This power that organized labor has should be limited so it does not far outweigh what the voters' priorities are.. Public sector unions often paralyze government operations.  There is a difference between representing their members' interests in the work environment versus actually using their influence to promulgate a specific political agenda.  This also happens when Unions either support or oppose legislative propositions on the basis of what is the best interest of their members versus what is in the best interest of the community.  Limits should be put on Unions' influence politically.  . Additionally, unions also tend to support employees who are usually poor performers and often work to defend them in situations where those poor performers have violated Department rules/policies.  Instead of supporting high performers and working to create incentives for workers that excel in their jobs, most of the Unions' time is spent defending and protecting employees who have been involved in progressive disciplinary matters.  Why is that unions must protect the lowest common denominators in terms of efficiencies, but rarely do anything for top performing members. . I work in a local government where it is extremely ""employee centric"" and for that matter, very labor friendly.  You have a Board of Supervisors who often compromises its values to ensure they are supportive of the Union's positions on issues and this creates an environment that is self-serving for their members, instead of creating an environment where we are ""customers centric"" and focused on producing the proper results and outcomes for our communities.. I believe practical parameters exist to try to minimize the level of political influence that Labor Unions can have on politicians and our political process.  I agree with you that we can find a way to fix these issues.  I would say that Unions should be more focused on working with Government on helping us provide better services to our citizens, versus simply pushing a political agenda that is self-serving.  Political reforms to help this can be researched to try to improve this relationship and impact on our democracy.

Right but ""abolishing"" the death penalty throughout  is an absolute conclusion - even when its clear cut that some criminals are surely deserving of execution as a penalty  - and the victims families have no recourse  - those victims lives can't be taken back  - I don't think it should be used lightly by any means - but surely an option for the presiding legal entity to seek the sentencing and be administered - again for certain specific crimes and convictions .. Again - are there not certain cases where there is absolutely no doubt  - hell even a confession from the defendant - video evidence - DNA etc...where in those itemized specific cases where there is no dispute in the commission of the egregiously violent acts - with a fair trial with all rights awarded to the defendant ...why take that right away from the states who want to carry that out.",4.44444444444444,4.27777777777778,4.66666666666667,1,1,4,6,6,"High","Low","Low","High"

Unions exist today to benefit the unions pocket books, not because there is a need to protect the employee.  . Unions are dying out simply because they are no longer needed.  There are so many laws and regulations that protect employees now.  It's not so much about ""fairness"" to an employee, but a way for employees to get more.  This spirals out of control such that organizations begin to drive salaries up to a point that is unsustainable.    I can't speak for all organizations, but most I know allow many opportunities for employees to have a voice.   Issue task forces and employee committees are commonly used in the public sector.   Many of the taxpayers would love to have the pay and benefits offered to public employees. . In the public sector, most organizations compare salaries and benefits with other agencies similar in size and scope.  The relationship becomes incestuous as union members demand more, and typically get more, at the expense of other employees and operations that are non-union.  It creates a financially unsustainable system, and the ones who lose out are the taxpayers.    Unions can destroy the morale of a high functioning organization, as it creates the haves and have nots.  It also binds management's hands and can actually cause union members to lose more than they could gain.. Many employees who say they want unions don't always understand what they are gaining/losing.  unions promise more pay and benefits, but the pot of money is limited, and should be fairly distributed to all employees who are public servants.   The cost of unionizing in our orgnanization is substantial - taxpayers have no idea of what they are paying for.    The culture. I agree that they cannot get more that what management is willing to pay, however the whole collective bargaining environment creates an atmosphere of win-lose and so much tension.   They often extend their rights into those of management, which further handcuffs an organizations ability to do what is right or best for the entire organization and community that is being served.  It has destroyed relationships in our organization and decreased effectiveness in the work groups who are unionized.  The community has lost out on many great6 services, simply becuase of cost to fund the union demands. ",497,"C13","Unions currently represent only 10-15% of the current population.  People that want to ""rein in"" unions really want to eliminate them.  Unions serve a lot of very important purposes.  Most importantly, unions give workers a voice -- not a controlling voice, but a voice.  Having that voice is important and serves a variety of public purposes.   For example, they allow workers to raise concerns and identify problems within the workplace.  They can also help expose corruption.  Public sector unions are even more important.  Public employees are easy targets.  Without unions, public employees would be at the mercy of the political party in charge.  Taxpayers do not always fully understand the consequences of budget cuts.  Unions do not prevent cuts, but rather provide an opportunity for an organized voice.   Unions are democratic institutions. . Unions do not exist to protect union pocket books; workers pay on average 1-2% of their salaries, and union staff get paid far less than private market wages.  People who work for unions do it for the same reason that people work for other non profit organizations - they believe that their work is important.  When the union movement was stronger, we had a more vibrant middle class.  The increasing amount of income inequality is consistent with the downturn of unions.  Without unions, those laws and regulations that are in place would go away.  Already anti-union forces are trying to drive down the minimum wage and eliminate paid sick leave, retirement benefits, etc. . Unions are needed more than ever.  The laws and regulations that protect employees exist because of unions, not in spite of them.  One of the most important protections that come within union contracts is just cause.  Without just cause, many professionals do not feel comfortable taking risk or speaking out; they feel their professional judgment is under attack.  More and more doctors, lawyers, and scientists are joining unions for that reason.  It is currently illegal for workers and management to engage in labor management meetings unless the group is organized.  That is why one of the major European car companies wanted to see a union in one of its South Carolina plants.  If the taxpayers want the same pay and benefits, they should demand them from their employer.  The low wages in the private sector are the problem; not the wages paid to public sector employees who are generally much more highly trained and educated than private sector employees . Unions cannot get more unless management is willing to pay more.  The easy answer to a union asking too much is to say ""no.""  It's not like unions walk into an employer and get exactly what they want.  It never happens that way, I promise.     Low morale is not caused by unions.  Unions typically cannot find traction to organize if there are good managers.  Even low pay is not enough to trigger a union organizing drive.  If you want to eliminate unions, improve the working conditions.  There is a reason that Starbucks and Costco have relatively low union rates, and very little public outcry by unions over that fact.  Walmart has constant threats of unions because they are an awful employer.    Unions make sure that there is balance in the workplace. . Many employees who say they are anti-union don't understand what they are voting against.  I agree that the pot of money needs to be equal, but in the absence of a union voice, employers tend to pay raises to their supervisors or to spread the money to whatever political issue is most appealing to them at the time.  With a union contract and a well run union, all that is guaranteed to union members is a voice and a conversation.  Those are not bad things.   The cost of organizing and unionizing should not be substantial.  If it is, it is being done wrong.  Many employers, including myself, prefer and WANT unions because they often deal with problems that I cannot and alert me to problems within my organization that I am not aware of because employees are too scared to tell me.

I think you are right, we need public unions to be strong in our society in a way that, the employees will secure their future.",90,"C7","I strongly agree that public sector unions should be reined in.  They are different than private sector unions.  While the private sector unions negotiate with owners and managers regarding pay and working conditions, public sector enterprises are funded by taxpayers and belong to taxpayers.  The ""boss"" is the taxpayer, and those politicians and public sector managers do not have the incentives to rein in public sector unions.  There are multiple conflicts within public sector unions, and it is unfair to taxpayers to, in essence, extort more funds from them to pay for services government is obligated to deliver.  Working conditions and pay can be addressed more equitably if there is less union involvement.  Taxpayers do NOT have a seat at the table, and many times foot the bill for publicly elected officials who serve the unions.  There are many examples of teachers getting elected to school boards, firefighters getting elected to city councils, etc.. Public employees are there to serve the public.  They are given other considerations, including job security, benefits, retirement, etc. that private sector employees do not get without the assistance of unions.  There is no balance in public sector unions, and there are multiple conflicts.  Elected officials take donations from unions and then vote the union way; union officials run for public office and vote the union way.  There is no balance on behalf of the taxpayer to consider sustainability.  The system has devolved into getting the maximum salary and benefits and pension, with no consideration of sustainability.  It can even be embedded in a state's constitution - it is in mine.  You have private sector workers who cannot retire at age 70, and public sector emplyees retiring at 50.  It's not fair.. I think there is a time and a place for unions.  Unions have done many good things in terms of working conditions and respect for workers.  But back when the idea of public sector unions was introduced, it was opposed by none other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democratic president, who said it would be the end of the American system of government.  There need to be checks and balances regarding fiscal sustainability, and keeping taxes low for those private sector taxpayers who are asked to pay more and more for public sector employees.  This past Great Recession really showed the differences between the private and public union systems.  The private sector unions decreased, the public sector unions increased, and the imbalance has gotten even more pronounced.. So how could we solve the problems for public sector employees without unions?  What structures would you recommend?  It's important for workers to have dignity and decent pay.  Public employment tends to be more secure, and have better benefits.  What constraints could be put in place?  I know from every level of govt I've worked in, the decisions have been rigged in favor of unions.  The impartial salary study turned out not to be.  The elected official took money from a union official.  I am hoping we can come up with a mechanism to fix????. I think independence is key.  An independent evaluation of the long-term sustainability of pensions.  (We need to do the same thing with Social Security!)  When these systems were put in place, the life expectancy was much shorter.  I've known a number of public employees - school supts, city managers - who retired on 6 figure salaries!!!!  How can we stop that gaming of the system which is supposed to provide a comfortable retirement as opposed to a $400,000 salary to retire.  Typically, these individuals then turn around and take another job.  So they double what they are making and become millionaires.  I worry about the average public worker who isn't playing these games.  The system cannot financially sustain these kinds of games.",4.27777777777778,5.72222222222222,5.05555555555556,7,2,5,3.33333333333333,4,"High","High","Low","Low"

The supreme court has recognized that almost every aspect of the death penalty meets the definition of cruel and unusual punishment. The death penalty is applied in a racist fashion, and evidence used to convict is often incorrect or misleading, leading to wrongful convictions. People should not be put to death by mistake. . The state should not be in the business of taking the lives of human beings, no matter what the cause. And, who decides ""unconverted"" DNA evidence - certainly not a jury, that can be influenced by racism or other bias. And, in the case of the prison hit, it is not DNA but testimony that convicts, which can be bought, corrupted or otherwise wrong. The cost of the death penalty, and the possibility of mistakes make it a price not worth paying. If one must punish severely, punish with solitary for life. . ""Eye for an Eye"" is not the basis for a civilized society. The state should not be in the business of exacting revenge for a crime on behalf of the victims, but for punishment and protection. Most important, taking a life is certainly a wrong, why should the people agree to let the state do that for a crime? As an advanced a civilized society, we should join the rest of the civilized world and abolish the death penalty. . As you point out, there is no such thing a ""uncontroverted"" DNA evidence. And the death penalty is unlike the punishment for other crimes, in that it is ""murder on behalf of the people"" and irreversible. And, any prisoner can recommit their crime in prison, even murderers that are not given the death penalty, (which most are not), so state sanctioned killing will not help that problem. . I agree with most of your statement, but if we admit that death should be reserved for those very very few, shouldn't we just abolish it all together? Isn't life without meaningful human contact (solitary) punishment enough? With so few times it can be used, and the tremendous cost in money and time that comes with the death penalty, it is simply time to recognize it is time for it to go, and to find another way.

I used to be of a mind that there was a biblical reason for the death penalty - an eye for an eye.    But, over time, I have seen that many cases have been turned over - where there was a corrupt DA, or evidence wasn't provided, or evidence was changed - and the person on death row was NOT the person that perpetrated the crime.   That meant that it was possible for an innocent person to be killed by the ""state.""  This haunts me.  The idea that an innocent person could be killed is overwhelmingly possible, and because of that, I feel that a mistake that great is not worth it.. I hear you - and understand that there are crimes that are so atrocious that might garner that type of punishment.  There have been cases where a jury of your peers - has actually not been used.  Cases in various states have shown significant maleficence, and the capital cases were overturned, since the jury was NOT of their peers. If the death penalty is being used as a crime deterrent - than it is also true that  states that have the Death Penalty have actually NOT seen a reduction in the amount of violent crimes committed.   . It's an incredibly difficult discussion.  Should Timothy McVeigh (sp?) been put to death? Probably.  It was overwhelmingly clear in that case.  However, there have been many cases this last year that were overturned -  fathers, sons, brothers, nephews, women? that would be gone - and lost, but are not, because they were overturned by the Innocence Project.  How can we be ABSOLUTELY sure that someone that is put to death, was absolutely the PERSON?  People are fallible - and the death cannot be taken back.  Ever.. The problem I see with ""checks and balances"" is that we are a country that is not of ""equals.""  We might say we are, but more black men are incarcerated (by percentages) than white.  We have a system that has and continues to fail many.  When we say we have checks and balances, and a jury of peers, but really don't, then we have essentially stacked the deck against those without means to pay for excellent legal representation.  That's essentially what was shown in the cases that were recently overturned.  The question might come down to - how do we ABSOLUTELY guarantee that THEY did it?  Is there a way to do that?. At the end of the day I wonder what we hope to accomplish by keeping the death penalty. - Is it a deterrant?  If so, that doesn't work. - it is for ""restitution?"" to make the victim's family feel better?  Many families have said that they don't want that blood on their hands. - Is it a punishment?

This scares some people. In as much, there is a logic for regulating their operations. However, this is not the same as ""reining them in"". Well functioning public sector unions, like other unions, represent the balancing mass for government management of its workforce and they are needed to insure that government employees, like private sector employees, benefit from a mode of representation and protection in the work environment.. It does not seem obvious to me that public sector unions have more political power than private sector unions. Intuitively, I would think that they actually have less. It would be interesting to see real data on this. To your point, the problem of ""clientele"" dependence of public elected officials is a major issue, that has plagued democracy since its beginning in Greece 2,000 years ago. Unresolved up to now, it seems to be part of ""the worst system except all others"" discussed by Churchill when talking about democracy.. I generally agree with your perspective, although I continue to associate public and private sector unions in the same discussion. The issue in terms of political influence ends up being  - i think - more linked to the use of $$$ in the political system, which unions raise very effectively, but which they are not the only ones to raise. PACs being a good example of this in the last election cycle. As usual, it boils down to ethical use of a system as opposed to unethical use of a system, i.e. unions focusing on labor issues as opposed to being a political . last word of the last post was ""weapon.""  Again, agreed! Unions have been and continue to be misused and abused. The problem is: do we try to fix this issue, or do we ditch the concept, with the risk of throwing the baby with the bath water. I would hope that this is an issue that deserve fixing rather than ditching because despite all abuses of the union concept, it has served a critical function in balancing labor relations. Get rid of it, and will the balance continue?. I certainly see your point, and face very similar challenges with local gov, state and even federal employees, some of them should never have been kept and would not have been were it not for the unions. No argument about this on my part. I am simply weary of system in which there is not counter power.

Certainly police are not always innocent and can SOMETIMES be the agitator, but compliance with police requests could in almost every case prevent ramping up. This is a case where the media attention and copycats have dangerously raised the bar in a bad way calling for violence against law enforcement, the majority of which are just trying to do their job and keep our communities safe.. I agree that even one innocent death is too many. THERE IS NO EXCUSE! However, the vast majority of law enforcement officers chose their career path much like we chose ours, they were passionate about serving their communities. The issues you raised are management issues and need to be addressed. The minority community (not all, but in part) calling for violence against police is completely counterproductive and will unfortunately result in the loss of more lives on both sides. . Again, what you raise are very important issues, but they are management issues. The focus should be on those departments that practice inappropriately. Unfortunately, the discussion has bled into areas where this was never an issue and the distrust may in irreparable. Bad cops should be dealt with properly (probably fired), and that includes their unions not protecting them, which has been an issue in some cases. It's a priveledge to serve, and should be treated as such.. Stereotypes will always exist. As community leaders, we need to do our part to break down those walls. Our system has checks and balances. Juries of their peers have both found officers guilty and not guilty. It's not fair to group them all together. Also, I completely respect your opinion. I do feel like there could be a better job done by minority leaders to support the work of law enforcement and encourage compliance. Body cameras will help a lot and tell the entire story, which I support. True. I see your point.

While in concept, I support unions and the employee rights that unions are designed to protect, I believe that unions may be exuding too much influences over some operational decisions.  The rights of the employees are valuable, but should be equally balanced with the organization's needs.   Once either two of those are out of whack, there is imbalance.  . I concur with your sentiment regarding the fact that certain individuals have created a bad name for some unions.  In fact, one of the things that gets under my skin is when the union elects to defend an employee that is clearly in the wrong.  I realize we all need to work.  That being said, it is important for unions to be ethical.  I know the unions have a job to do and they address abuses by employers, I cannot agree with them supporting the abuse of an employee. . I agree with you comments regarding the differences between the types of unions and the levels of influence.  I did not intend to imply that all unions were the same.  In my state, I would agree that public safety employees do garner the lion's share of compensation, when it comes to wages.   In the last two years, there has been a tremendous amount of pension reform to address the inequity.  My hat is off to teachers, who work so hard for such little pay.  That being said, the Teachers Union (where I live) is one of the most powerful union in the state.. I would agree that the right to representation is important.   In truth, the union representatives have assisted me a time or two in convincing the employee that it made more sense to be truthful and to take their discipline, rather than to be disciplined or fired for untruthfulness.  In addition, I do my best to keep the unions informed of impending changes in the organization.    By giving them advanced notice, I have seen benefits.  They can answer questions of their members before things are misunderstood. . I absolutely agree with you.  The unions provide tremendous benefit to organizations and government.  I am, however, always concerned with things occur, as they did in Wisconsin, and the government is held at bay.

However I think that reactions of this sort are never completely rational - once deep felt anger is unleashed, particularly when it roots so far back - it is difficult to control. I think there is a huge issue of leadership involved, both from official side and from the minority groups themselves, in channeling the anger and riots into constructive action.. I am finding it difficult to disagree with you :) I do hope that the reactions have resonance and that both politicians, police departments and media show responsibility and truly work to get to the heart of the issue. I don't think there are quick fixes. And I think that a great deal of the solution actually lies outside policing realm, but is a larger societal issue. . Yes education and a change of culture within the police force is crucial. Still there is also a police reality to understand. They are confronted, in their daily dealings, with a lot of concrete crime, hostility, etc from minority groups. This does not justify police brutality or bias against minorities, but must be taken into consideration when dealing with the issue.  So there is also an issue of bringing minority groups to engage with the police in a constructive way. Thank you for sharing your opipnion.. Sorry, though we were over...

They have helped bring in the 40 hr work week, overtime pay, and minimum wages.  They have also been a voice for people who were basically powerless due to their low station in life.  My state, Florida, is a right to work state and it is shameful the level of wages paid to our workers.    The fact is that unions are needed in the public sector so that workers are not mistreated.  No worker should serve the public for 30-40 years and then retire into a live so full of poverty they need government assistance.    . I think that we basically agree, or only have a very small difference of opinion.  To more clearly understand your position I would need to understand your definition of reining them in slightly.  In addition, not all public sector unions are the same.  Police and Fire unions are typically successful in obtaining better wages and working conditions for their workers in my state.  Unions that represent teachers and blue collar workers are not as successful.  Teachers in my state can work 10 years and only make about $42,000 with a Master of Education Degree.  I think that is shameful and is definitely not a living wage.  I agree we need balanc. I used to feel the exact same way that you do in regard to unions defending employees that are clearly wrong.  Upon further reflection, I realized that it is their job to represent their employees, just as a defense attorney's job is to represent their client.  I believe this is important to our system.  Although, on some individual cases where the employee is clearly wrong it is annoying to me when this happens, I still believe in the overall concept of them being able to have representation.  .

I believe that opportunity for collective bargaining rises all salaries and makes work better for all employees regardless of if they are unionized. I also believe that for public sector employees we should be modeling best practices for treating and  compensating employees and unions were created to facilitate just that.. In my experience, certainly there have been some who are poor performers just as in the non-unionized work force. I do believe it is up to the unions to make certain their unionized employees are working hard to represent and not taking advantage of being ""protected."" I also know that we can pay less for non-unionized workforce and my primary concern is that perpetuates underpaid workforce and contributes to the challenges hard working families have making ends meet. . Public sector salaries are public record. As far as benchmarking work product, I think that would be very interesting to make public record, we are using tools such as ""LEAN"" for our public sectors which does include benchmarking and those reports are made available to the public. Regarding ""bad apples"" there does need to be a way to work with unions to not retain employees who do not meet certain outputs and that is negotiated with the unions.. I'm not sure what BMP's are. That said, I agree with best pay for best work. What I appreciate about unions is that we set a base salary and from there the raises etc are competitive. I don't believe that poor performance is as widespread amongst union workers as I am interpreting your message to be. There are mechanisms in place to fire poor performers and unions need to be held to those.. You mentioned benchmarking and I think that if union outputs were benchmarked and made public record we could be producing model outputs for all to see.

They played an important role in protecting employees from unfair labor practices. However, like so many organizations, they have, in many cases gone too far. They have become self serving, protecting union bosses more than workers. They have undue influence in elections, not necessarily representing the wishes of the employees. They force employees to participate often against their will.  In many cases they have run up the cost of goods, forcing many companies overseas. . I agree that union's once did just that. Fought for better wages, benefits and working conditions. Now their primary role is the continued support of union bosses. Driving up wages has cost many workers jobs. Take for example the epic failure of the auto industry when manufacturers left Detroit due to an inability to meet labor demands.  All of the businesses who have gone overseas have done so due to high labor costs. . They also protect incompetent employees, protecting their jobs at the detriment of the organization. It is nearly impossible to fire an ineffective employee who has union protection. This is unfair to other workers who have to take up the slack.. Jobs have been exported due to high wages. It's the high wages that drives up other costs, etc. This leaves business owners no choice but to find other sources of labor.  In a sense the same applies to public sector jobs. When someone is forced to keep a bad employee on staff due to union protections it hurts other people who are deserving of and qualified for that same job.   Good work habits should be rewarded not bad . I agree that they sometimes do protect a workers rights. But I believe that today they do more harm than good. I assume you mean the union bosses who just want control without laws. We have labor laws that protect people, we don't need unions.

Being angry and calling attention to the issue and the specific matter at hand are all worthwhile efforts.  However, rebellious uprising that causes damage to the neighborhoods that are already struggling will only perpetuate the problems.

I am happy to see the discussion being brought into the light and part of a meaningful dialogue.  I would hope that the actions of police officers that do not respect people and basic rights are not repeated and that real punishment is meted out when they do something wrong.  What I hate to see though, is the picking and choosing by teh media of how they cover it.  There are plenty of videos of inceidents that are never shown. I can see how the minority leaders who have certainly pursued more diplomatic paths can be given no more than lip service by the established authorities.  When that isn't given its due respect,  the general public is going to lash out.  It's that lashing out though that feeds the insecurities of others.

",396,"D67","Public sector unions need to be reined in because they have become out of control. Many states now suffer from huge budget deficits due to the union monopolies that have lead to costly fringe benefits and sweetheart pension deals. The unions have put the public sector above the needs of the taxpayers who fund government. If we are to take back control of government for the taxpayers we must rein in public sector unions and put the power back in the hands of the people.. I believe that unions have a role in the private sector, but not in the public sector. Workers in the private sector should most definitely have the right to collectively bargain should they choose.  However, their is an inherent conflict of interest when you are talking about unions in the public sector. Public sector workers are supposed to be servants of the people, yet the union approach has been to maximize benefits for those they represent regardless of the out come of the employer, who in this instance is the taxpayer. You can't take a union approach in the public sector and still serve the people. . I don't disagree with you when that approach is in the private sector. However, we have seen the results of public sector union domination in states around the country. Illinois is just one state that is facing unbelievable cuts to services or tax increases that the average citizen can  not afford.  Again this is a conflict of interest for what should be public servants. Public servants should be in similar situations with cost of health care etc as the general public, but the unions have placed those employees above the citizen. I think it is very interesting that you bring up teachers as your example. Unions are best applied in situations with skilled or unskilled labor and businesses are taking advantage of that work force. In general most professional occupations do not want union representation because it makes everyone the same. We all know that their are great teachers and below average teachers. Why shouldn't a great teach view themselves as a professional and be rewarded for excellence in the classroom. On the other side of the argument why should a poor teacher be given the same pay and benefits that an excellent teacher has earned? Many young energetic teachers fall to the budget cutting sword and poor teachers are kept because of senority. I think examples all over the country have proven that to be a rosy view of how unions operate in the public sector.  I have experienced first hand at least three situations that unions simply refused to bargain in good faith despite the fact that the entire country was in one of the worst recession in generations. Public sector employees should be able to take advantage of boom times, just like the rest of their community by getting raises and better opportunities, but in times of recession public sector employees should also be subject to cost cutting. Unions are too rigid and inflexible in those situations. ",6.5,4.22222222222222,6.05555555555556,7,5,5,6.66666666666667,5,"Low","Low","High","High"

Lynchings and killings of minorities have happened throughout American history. However, now we have proof in real time through cell phone videos and Facebook Live.  There are real issues between police and the communities they serve that are only being addressed because of the attention being paid through Black Lives Matter and other protests. This is how things improve, even if it is hard and difficult to discuss. . I can understand that you may feel that the media is not focusing on the actual facts at hand that may have led to a confrontation, or the conditions around it. However, to simply view these confrontations as individual interactions misses the point, in my opinion. These deadly encounters are simply the focal point to discuss issues that do not always end up in life or death, such as access to community services, segregation in housing and education.  It is only because of the graphic nature of these interactions that we are able discuss these issues.. I agree that too many lives are lost to people acting with impunity, however I think it is the police that act with impunity. I sleep safe at home because I live in a wealthy community that is largely segregated based on covenants that determined who could buy in the neighborhood when it was built over a century ago. That has led directly to a community where wealth and property are concentrated.  Also, I think my community is safe because we have a number of people looking out for each other, and that the police really just act to protect property, not people.. I have been on ride alongs, and I have family who were in law enforcement. We agree that people in law enforcement are fallible, but our institutions have fallen too far on the side of the police. I also believe that our police are not properly trained to de-escalate situations, instead often ratcheting up situations that did not have to be deadly.   And I never said that we should disobey rule of law. I am in violent agreement! I think that our laws should work for everyone, not to protect those in power.. I'm sorry that I mis-communicated that I have no need for police. Police are needed in certain situations. I just believe that police are not the only tool available to promote public safety. I believe communities that are healthy overall are safer communities. Part of having the resources to be healthy is wealth, unfortunately.   I think your experiment might be to consider that for many people in our country, calling the police is a fraught decision, where they may be considered a criminal and target.

People have a right to live/life. 2. How could the person who issued their death live with themselves. 3. I dont believe in something/a punishment that I wouldn't inflict on someone else and I would never kill anyone.. What if the person is innocent?  There are numerous examples of when this has happened.     If the issue is prison costs - surely the solution lies with preventing people from committing crimes in the first instance? E.g focusing on kids and developing healthy environments to thrive in/learn in and support developing.  Cost shouldn't be used as a deciding factor when it comes to someones life.. Surely eye for an eye mentality is biblical and old school.  I agree that there should be a proportional punishment but there is a reason why the death penalty is no longer in place in most first world countries.  Whose to say the criteria for the death penalty isnt changed where lesser charges are given that sentence - is that still ok?  I dont think there is any justification for death.  You would never get peace if you lost a son and that person died that way through revenge.  . But its someones life- in the middle east recently a woman was killed because she was raped by another man who wasnt her husband- whose to say that the criteria for the death sentence here wont change? Or that the technique wont.  I've seen the green mile.  What if it affected you directly and someone in your family was on death row?

The whole ""eye for an eye"" thing makes absolutely no sense here and does not factor into my belief.  My belief is simple and based on two factors - 1) It costs WAY too much to maintain prisons and account for the welfare of prisoners who have committed death penalty-worthy offenses.  2) I firmly believe there are times and offenses committed which justify us pulling your card.  You did this...you're done.. I agree people have the right to live.  I also believe there are crimes where that person has lost that right.  Several DUIs....you lost the right to drive.  Murder....you lost the right to live.  I know that's a huge leap, but I think it has a philosophical correlation.  How could people live with themselves?  I'm sure we could find people who don't mind doing that task.  For example...I don't believe in God....I don't think there is some great galactic comeuppance coming my way if I press the button for a lethal injection.  Lastly,  if someone killed my son...I'd absolutely want to inflict that back. Yes...innocence is a factor...and death penalty legislation would require a commensurate amount of checks and balances on the legal process to ensure guilt.  With the advent of DNA technology, I think we are seeing better examples of ""pure and incontrovertible guilt.""  The ""cost"" issue is twofold.   Yes, I think education programs matter, too...and getting kids to better understand the right and wrong of death.  But I firmly believe there are times when people have just lost the right to be here.  It's darwinism.. If there is no justification for death, than there is no justification for police to have guns and for the U.S. to have military members flying planes with bombs abnd deploying SEAL teams to defeat ISIS.  Death is a fact...and we commit it every day through a series of codified examples.   If we do away with official instruments of death, than you do away with a lot.  I believe In death as a natural scientific thing.  If I come down with a terrible disease or just want to die, then I should have access to euthanasia.  No God determines my life or death.  Its science.  Similarly, I believe if you've done something that a jury of your peers feels is death-worthy, than you get it.. Totally fair, and I respect your views.  That's the middle east.  You're talking generations of tribal SOP.  In the USA - and we're talking death penalty laws in the USA - I think we have instances of death-penalty worth offenses, and if a jury decides it...it's decided.  If it's my son or anyone else I love, and thy've lost their right to live, then I stand by it.  It is what it is....if I don't want to wear a seat belt...or a helmet on a motorcycle...or want to climb Mount Everest....or kill someone...I believe in the primary establishment of death as an outcome.",4.77777777777778,4.77777777777778,5.33333333333333,1,3,3.33333333333333,3.33333333333333,6,"High","Low","Low","Low"

Looking at the decline of public sector unions over the last few decades, I noticed a similar decline in the income equality in our country and the corresponding decline of the middle class.  Public sector itself operates more effectively when the workers form a union to have a voice at the table.  We perform the work, recognize patterns and trends within our workplaces and work with management to resolve issues and make our area of employment more productive.  We also serve in our communities by actively engaging in volunteer opportunities , becoming active in our schools and churches and giving back to the comm. Maybe at some earlier point in our history did union have such power. Now we are more civic minded, more open to discussions rather than coercion, and with the rise of lobbyists and special interest think tanks, public sector unions are needed now more than ever to ensure vital services are protected, and that people who work hard serving their communities are afforded the same chance of having a decent middle class lifestyle. Its sounds like you had a bad experience with a union leader or representative in your past. We are all not one in the same. Like elected's for example we come from diverse backgrounds, but also have similar shared values. In my union experience, we have become more aggressive in policing our own; reining in any abuses or removing those who would abuse their members for their own personal gain.  Afterall we are your neighbors, workers inour community. I agree there are negatives n any organizations.

",270,"D48","Unions play an important part in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected and that a balance is found between the desire of employers in taking advantage of the human resource available to it.  Without this, pay and conditions would be eroded to a point where living wages would not be met, and where there would be an inevitable reduction in social cohesion resulting from this.  History and other countries have shown that where unions are weak or non existent that the rights of workers are eroded and where social inequality and poverty increases.  This weakens the fabric of com. Noted, while budgets are obviously important, they should not necessarily dictate the terms and conditions of employees.  A benchmark for appropriate pay and conditions could be made with private sector areas of employment which are similar in nature or in responsibility/skill-set and as such this should reflect a balanced approach to wage and condition setting.. Custom and practise in certain areas will dictate level and extent of union representation. It may well be that a volunteer service is seen more as a community service without pay/conditions being a  primary motivator. Similarly, most voluntary services will have the volunteer being in receipt of paid employment elsewhere, hence the lesser need for union representation to assist in negotiating terms and conditions.. Noted, it can be quite easy to use budget limitations as a reason for not discussing appropriate wages and conditions.   There are very successful examples of Countries where unions have actually contributed to economic stability, social cohesion etc. in return for fair and reasonable discussions on pay and conditions. This aids and assists in such Countries reflecting a political and economic stability. Agreed, a merit based system would be ideal, however, it is a difficult area to measure.

There are numerous examples of when this has happened.     If the issue is prison costs - surely the solution lies with preventing people from committing crimes in the first instance?

If employees want to form a union to bargain for better wages, safety, workplace accommodations, etc. they should be allowed to do so. I don't think the relationship between unions and management has to be adversarial. There are examples where both sides get along to serve the best interest of all public employees.  . I don't dispute that sometimes collective bargaining agreements have resulted in unreasonable benefit guarantees that have left taxpayers holding the bag. But I think, on the whole, unions still serve a purpose. It's important that workers feel that they have a voice in the workplace and that management listens to them. Sometimes this can only be accomplished through union representation. . I think you raise an interesting distinction between private sector and public sector unions. But, in my mind, the two still aren't incompatible. Take teachers, for example. Most teachers are represented by unions and rightfully so- on average we don't compensate teachers like the professionals they are. I agree that public sector employees should first be focused on serving the public. But I don't think that means they have to abandon their right to collectively bargain. In both the private and public sector, management issues can exist that necessitate union representation. . I would agree that public sector unions do need to be more reasonable when it comes to being sensitive to the fact that taxpayers fund public employee salaries. I have been involved in the creation/continuation of union representation at multiple levels of government and I have found that most of the time public sector unions understand tight budgets and can't always get a raise/increase in benefits for their employees. But I don't dispute your correlation between budget issues and unreasonable benefit packages. . I think you bring up a fair point about teacher unions and how they view their employees. It's one of the issues where I depart from teachers unions- I believe every student deserves access to a great teacher and we should compensate better teachers accordingly. But I bring up that point because teachers are horribly paid and union representation usually results in better pay and benefits. If teacher unions stick to that core mission of raising salaries for teachers, I still think it's a good thing.

Having worked with the media, i've seen the tendency to get the story out absent all the facts and to sensationalize.  I have experience where police staff have developed working relations with the entire community and believe the solution is communication no matter how difficult.  This can expose some bad players on both sides.  The recent accidental shooting of a 17 year old led to a community discussion that while charged was actually very progressive.  Some cities are making good inroads into this issue.. Preservation of human life should be foremost in the minds of the police.  The question becomes whose life.  I believe there is a right for protection but that lethal use of force is a last resort.  The officers in my city have become very good at de-escalating situations and police shootings have become very rare.  The key is community engagement at all levels, involvement by all parties and to look forward to solve this issue rather than back,  I appreciate your position that all life is sacred.  Also that persons have rights to their persons and belongings.. I think your comments are helpful.  I have personally attended the meetings with police officers and the community where they aired significant grievances.  The police in my city have become a training model for the rest of the county.  It takes a progressive captain, community support, partnerships and great leadership by all sides.  That is something to work for with the goal of not one more needless death or humiliation.  Yet the community feels safe and protected.  That is a world I can believe in.. Our points of view are similar, possibly from different sides of the same issue.  I think we agree on the sacredness of human life and rights.  We agree that progressive communication and engagement are keys to moving forward.  I wish you were on my team as we address this extremely important issue.  Thanks for your honesty and open mind.  Our leadership is key.. The death of the 17 year old was an unfortunate ricochet in a dangerous case.  Within a week we had a community meeting and, because of the groundwork layed before, were able to have a real conversation of these issues without being totally under the cloud of this unfortunate incident.  I can never express to the parents of this child the sorrow of our police or my own anguish that something like that could happen in my town.  The parents actually had the high ground and expressed their sorrow but also forgiveness.  As a parent I don't know if I could do that in their shoes.  It was heartbreaking.

The coverage is extensive in areas that are not predominantly or historically over ridden with crime.   This topic has hit the  forefront of newspapers and the media because it's been occurring in areas that historically crimes like shootings have not been occurring.  Other places in the world and in other major cities have had confrontations but hasn't received the coverage because it's the ""norm"" and boring.. I agree with your statements.  With the advent of tech and social media confrontations between the police and minority criminals have been seen more, but it's always been there.   The media took a hold of it and turned it into a ratings game because nobody wants to see boring scenes or footage from something ""nice"" anymore.  That doesn't attract viewers.  Pitting minorities and police against each other creates a story.  . For instance, when major news outlets cover these events of police confrontations they're from eastern seaboard states or from the midwest.  These confrontations have been going on in major cities for decades, but you don't see CNN, MSNBC, Fox or any other news network coming to Chicago, NYC, LA or any other major metropolitan city to cover every shooting and incident.   My point is that the incidents have been occurring for a long time and when one incident hits FB, twitter, and instagram, the media grabs a hold of it and emotions start ruling the day. .

They buy votes and politicians. Selects who runs for office and destroy the opposition. These are not American values. They are guerrilla tactics not having a place in a civil society. Nowhere in the world are unions of much added value. The greater good for the greatest number is achieved by individuals working hard and not taking stuff from others by coercion or by force as unions do. Unions should be abolished in the U.S. if we are to be considered a First World Nation.. Your points are the talking points of a union. They don't add up to much other than to rationalize the law of the jungle in our civil society. The facts are that labor does  nothing for its members. They sacrifice the good of the member for the specific agenda set in by the bosses. Unions are about power grabs. I look forward to the U.S. Supreme Ct abolishing closed shop - a form of coercion into people's pocket books. I've seen first hand the harm unions do at the Capitol and in society. It's very sad. I hope you change your mind.. So you do agree about the negatives of the unions and how much harm they have caused us. It's a bit too late to try to mend fences. You have not convinced your membership that you bring value to their lives and families. When closed shop goes away, you will see how people flee in droves from your roles. Why not reform unions in a way that they offer public value? I think you would agree with me that change is in order. Now you will try to forces people to sit in on mandatory orientations but you will not have the same effect as in closed shop. The Legislatures will give you that but they cannot mandate membership.. I'm not talking about one specific person but as the entity of organized labor. The bosses have failed to live to the ideal that unions set out to achieve. The bosses paint ideals they don't uphold. Look: Big salaries; spending membership money on their own sub-entities: it's really collusion and fraud. I cannot see how a person who works in the union does not see that or has not seen it. Again, the public value or social values of unions is low to none. They should be regulated and limited, i.e., they should be reigned in.. I do see that your intentions are noble.

It does not promote justice, but rather is vengeful. We are not perfect in our administration of justice, and the risk of executing an innocent is also unacceptable.  It is an irreversible decision.  It represents an indulgence of our urge for vengeance. Exercising the death penalty makes us no better than the murderer. How can we teach that murder is w  . My concern with financial arguments is that killing to save money seems wrong to me.  We are capable of keeping violent convicted criminals from harming others. If we fail to do so, that is a reflection of our collective failing. I cannot justify taking that failing out on the convict by choosing to kill them as an alternative to taking responsibility for safely preventing them from harming others.  . Even when a lengthy appeals process is available and competent counsel is available to the defendant, I remain concerned that biases may remain in our application of the death penalty. Even if our administration of justice were perfect, I am still concerned that we do not need to kill.  When we collectively decide to do so, are we not responsible as shareholders in the killing? I am not comfortable with that once a suspect has been arrested. We are in control at that point so it's no longer self defense.  . I do agree that there is cost involved in incarcerating convicted criminals. I accept this cost rather than moving to execute prisoners to save funds.  My concern about our imperfect application of justice is with regard to wrongful convictions. I do agree that prison guards deserve safe working conditions. We should absolutely be funding prison operations adequately to ensure safe working conditions for those who are locked up, and for those who work there. I cannot justify killing inmates as an alternative to our collective failure to accomplish this task effectively.. I appreciate your concern for the safety of those working in the prison system. I do agree that they deserve to work safely. My preference would be to provide safe working conditions for all who work in our criminal justice system to the best of our ability.

The death penalty option in the most serious cases would be ideal, but the concern is that under the current legal framework where the guilt-innocence phase of a trial is separate from sentencing the risk remains that the death penalty could be imposed for crimes that were not committed.  'Justice' can be an elusive objective - the greater good is to ensure a sentence of life in prison.      . The justice system is by its very nature inefficient and is not infallible as measured by the surely thousands of false convictions that happen in criminal courts every year.  Admittedly most of those convictions do not involve capital cases.  The problem in short that it is difficult to ensure a fully vetted and just outcome.     . Your argument is a good one - how do we re-engineer the justice system to ensure that only appropriate cases, where there is absolutely no question of guilt or innocence, are eligible for the death penalty.

The first is philosophical or moral:  If killing is wrong it is always wrong.   Second, is financial:  Because the system needs to assure that we do not put someone to death who is either not guilty or not mentally competent the process is lengthy and costly.  I don't recall the actual numbers but it tremendously more expensive then keeping someone in jail.   Third, . The third reason I didn't get into my first argument is that our criminal justice system is biased and minorities and mentally incompetent people are much more likely to become a part of the system.  I understand the emotion of an eye for an eye and that some atrocities are too horrid to forgive.  However, I can't get past my first two arguments.  It is factually cheaper to jail someone than to kill them because the system needs to make sure it makes no mistake.    Plus now with DNA evidence we know that we have put some innocent people both in jail and on death row.  How wrong is it for the state to kill someone who turns out to be innocent.  Can we ever take that chance?. I see a major difference with a law enforcement officer using deadly force in order to protect himself or the public in the moment.  We don't however let officers use deadly force when there isn't an imminent risk.    Killing for war is admittedly a different situation.  And I have much discomfort around this behavior as well.

",413,"E16","I disagree, when considering atrocities such as the Boston bombing and many other acts of terror, i believe our justice system should have the right to use the death penalty just as police forces can use lethal force if necessary. I think guidelines should be in place to ensure that other issues such as mental health of the convicted are taken into consideration but i have faith that the justice system can make the right judegment. in addition there are huge costs with life incarecerat. it is very costly to keep people in jail for life.   I disagree that killing is always wrong. In fact our government does it everyday all over the world. if the result is justified under the parameters of the law then i think society has an obligation to use the tools for justice . we take those chances all the time in war and policing our streets. innocent people do die. but the law and guidelines set by governments should be followed and tools and punishments like the death penalty are needed as tools for the justice system, that doesnt mean they should always be used but i dont believe in taking away a tool to deliver justice.  I think your argument is the emotional argument -- society always does decide who lives or dies based on so many factors -- for example abortions. . I dont disagree that if there are alternatives to war or the death penalty that they should be used first, all i am saying is that we should not deprive our justice system of the ultimate punishment. just as it would be unconscionable to deprive a woman's right to chose or a police officers right to shoot and kill if there is danger.   I just think there need to be guidelines that are strict and in place but still accessible to our justice system - i am not a fan of taking away possible tools from our justice system. let them deliver what is just under the guidelines of the law  . we agree on abortion - i believe it is their right and we should not deprive them of that right. just like we should not deprive our justice system of the right under the law to put to death an individual.  the death penalty is just because it equalizes morality - it sets an ultimatum that if you take a life yours could be taken. which is true of even non criminals.",3.61111111111111,4.38888888888889,3.66666666666667,3,1,4,3.66666666666667,4,"Low","Low","Low","High"

",166,"E10","I disagree with the idea that the public reaction to recent confrontations has been overblown.  The United States has a long history of inequitable police-community relations across racial groups.  I think it is understandable that minority, particularly African American, populations have reacted vigorously.  Prior to the Civil Rights era, African Americans were frequently subjected to lynchings, segregation, and violence with official sanction.  This is within the living memory of many.  Going back further, there is even more violent history going back to and prior to the Civil War.. I agree with you.  I also think it is important to understand the historical context that has driven the actions of police, as well as minority communities.  The notion that police actions have sometimes been disproportionate to the offense is one that I agree with.  I'm not sure how often police are motivated by race.  I would like to see better data on this to improve my understanding.. I think non-violent protest is appropriate in our culture.  I think this raises the visibility of the issue or injustice without creating negative public sentiment toward the protesters.  Generally, I think this is what has been happening with respect to police-community relations.  News coverage is sometimes sensationalized.  I think incidents of violence on the part of the community have been relatively rare.  I think the protesters have been effective in driving the conversation toward change.. I don't think history ever ceases to be a factor, but I do think police and community can be less motivated by history when they have a shared awareness of it.  One group seems to have a different sense of history than the other, or at least to prioritize one narrative over the other.  I think police can have a more empathetic approach if they have a better understanding of the historical context of minority communities.  There seem to be some positive steps toward this.  Implicit bias training is being implemented in some communities, as are accountability measures like body-worn cameras, which can help to change behavior.. We seem to agree on a great deal!  I do think non-violent protest can provoke a violent reaction, so unfortunately those protesting are taking risks.  I wish it was not necessary for people to risk their personal safety to make their opinion known or highlight an injustice.

Without a doubt, mistakes have been made. In my opinion, the death penalty has been used too liberally across criminal offenses. I think it should be reserved for only the most exceptional cases, and the wishes of the criminal should be incorporated into the process (if they want an expedited process). I agree, vengeance should never be a motivator for punishment. Much like you should never punish a child our of anger, we cannot let emotions dictate extreme cases. My first date with my husband was a wedding, where the groom was a police officer. Three months after his wedding, he was shot and killled in the line of duty responding to a domestic call. The criminal hid in the bushes and shot him when he arrived on scene. Because he shot and killed a police officer, he was automatically considered for the death penalty, and was sentenced to death.  I dont necessarily agree with that. We are sensationalizing a line of duty death, as though that of a neighbor or friend isn't worthy of such a  severe penalty. . I agree. I also think as a country we need to invest more in parenting and childcare. Many career criminals who have been studied have shown they lacked proper care and intervention in their home-life as children. We see kids in the foster care system have disproportionately higher rates of criminal convictions than those children in traditional , biological homes. Prevention even starts at birth; children who are neglected as infants can develop a myriad of conditions, including things like Reactive Attachment Disorder, where they lack empathy and don't regard the needs of others. These children can grow up to be adults with dangerous prerogatives.",6.5,5.61111111111111,6.66666666666667,1,2,5,6,6,"Low","High","High","High"

The first is philosophical or moral:  If killing is wrong it is always wrong.   Second, is financial:  Because the system needs to assure that we do not put someone to death who is either not guilty or not mentally competent the process is lengthy and costly.  I don't recall the actual numbers but it tremendously more expensive then keeping someone in jail.   Third, . The third reason I didn't get into my first argument is that our criminal justice system is biased and minorities and mentally incompetent people are much more likely to become a part of the system.  I understand the emotion of an eye for an eye and that some atrocities are too horrid to forgive.  However, I can't get past my first two arguments.  It is factually cheaper to jail someone than to kill them because the system needs to make sure it makes no mistake.    Plus now with DNA evidence we know that we have put some innocent people both in jail and on death row.  How wrong is it for the state to kill someone who turns out to be innocent.  Can we ever take that chance?. I see a major difference with a law enforcement officer using deadly force in order to protect himself or the public in the moment.  We don't however let officers use deadly force when there isn't an imminent risk.    Killing for war is admittedly a different situation.  And I have much discomfort around this behavior as well.  However, I recognize that there are times when as a nation it is necessary.  However, if we had or have alternatives, I would argue we should use them first.. Is the death penalty justice?  To me it is not.  It doesn't act as a deterrent, it doesn't change outcomes for what has already occurred.  It may make some folks feel better but it doesn't help society.   I'm guessing we may also disagree on a woman's right to have access to abortion.. If it were an effective tool of justice, I'd likely agree with you.  But I've seen no evidence that it is.    If I felt our justice system treated all people equally, I might also agree.  But having served on multiple jurysin the past I know it does not.  Perhaps working on reforming our justice system to be more fair would be the place to start.  ",6.11111111111111,3.72222222222222,5.61111111111111,7,4,5,6.33333333333333,4,"Low","Low","High","Low"

I agree that trust requires very high standards for behaviour and professionalism.  However, there are a majority of police professionals that do hold themselves and other to high standards.  A very low number of cases end with bad outcomes yet the public view of police is very low.. This is hard to argue.

We give up our rights to some degree so that the police can keep us safe.  When the police violate that trust, even once, it is a profound violation.  This issue can't be overblown.  Although I am confident that confrontations are rare,  the standards for our police must be very high, the standard needs to be zero violations.  . Yeah, social media has made the public more aware of instances of confrontations.  The awareness wasn't there before.  So I think awareness is positive, and the new era we are in will involve change, and change is always painful, but we must and will confront what is now known and visible.  I also appreciate how body cams show us the hundreds of incredible acts police make that is 100% the right actions, for every one instance of bad behavior.  . Interesting.  Yes, a bad apple ruins the barrel.  Organizations need to self organize and self ""police.""  I think the public view of police is not that low (ok, some places it is low), but overall the public appreciate their police, and as we clean out the few bad actors, and hold ourselves to the standard of NO criminal acts by police, the public perception will just get better and better.  Let's strive for the best!. Yes, I agree with you about the unbalanced media characterization.  I agree.  However, social media is actually pretty good and showing viral pictures of cops holding babies from a car crash scene, showing cops helping youth who have a history of trouble, where main stream media paints cops and the devil, social media shows us many, many of the incredible acts from our public safety officers.   .

In addition, in the US, the costs associated with death penalty court cases and resulting appeals are significantly higher than the cost of lifetime incarceration. . I agree some offenders should never be allowed back into society because they cannot be rehabilitated, but is cost a good reason for the government to end a human life? I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here, but again, my personal belief is no. There are also numerous studies showing how many innocent people have been executed under the death penalty. Knowing we can never eliminate that possibility, and that as time passes evidence may show someone convicted of a crime to in fact be innocent, how can we morally sentence them to death?. Very fair point about potentially only using this in exceptional and extreme cases. There are many cases I've read about, including in my home town, where I would want to be personally able to sentence the offender to death. However, that has a feel of vengeance to me (I know in some cases that's certainly how I feel), and I don't want the government to be in the business of vengeance. Protection, yes. . Very fair points about the death penalty being used too liberally and potentially using it just for extreme cases. I also very much believe we need to reform our prison system to both reduce costs and ensure we're not treating our prisoners better than we're treating our children and veterans, or our troops. We are spending far too much money on our prisons. We also incarcerate people at the highest rate in the civilized world on a per capita basis. I honestly don't know enough about the key law enforcement issues at hand to propose how to solve this, but I think solving the incarceration rate and cost is the key. . I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your tragic experience, and I find it remarkable that given what you went through, that you're still able to have a balanced, rational conversation about this. I don't know that I could in the same circumstance. I also could probably be convinced on a case-by-case basis that certain people should be sentenced to death for certain crimes, but the problem is that I would draw that line in a different way than you would or any of a thousand other people would. Without some clear way to draw a line the strong majority of people can agree on, I'd rather just not have it be an option for our government.",6.5,4.33333333333333,5.61111111111111,7,2,4.66666666666667,7,6,"High","Low","High","High"

I think that part of the reason why we are seeing such economic and political angst in communities, particularly those of color - but also in communities of working class whites - is because workers feel less connected to each other and as such feel like they have a diminished ability to speak up in the workplace. Unions should have more influence. . Maybe consider thinking of unions as important partners in the conversation about efficient and effective public service and goods delivery. The costs associated with union contracts are usually significantly lower than contracting out for services, especially when these services have traditionally been done in house and private, than when governments contract out with for profit companies .   . I believe that, unfortunately, limiting the voices of workers who are coming together to advocate for stronger wages, working conditions and in some cases, better equipment, transparency and accountability to the public regarding the delivery of services (that these workers are invested in because they are also consumers and taxpayers), would lead to a lack of true sincerity in addressing concerns. I agree with training a strong work force, but unless you have organized feedback to create a useful dialogue with management, management would also suffer from not having an efficient avenue to sort legitimate and illegitiate concerns from workers. . Unfortunately, there have been a litany of examples of public goods being privatized without due diligence and full transparency. I believe to assume that cost efficiency is the only variable in this equation leads to profoundly negative outcomes in the community and in the future provision of services. Also, another way to think about htese benefits is that the cost is being born somewhere and if you do not provide benefits - particularly for workers who take less than they often would to provide the same or similar services in the private sector is a bad idea because . I can't type fast enough.  I'm sorry.   Plain and simple, the impetus for the workers comp leg you speak of were unions and workers. Unions could - and do, in many places, work collaboratively with employers to strength and propose legislation. In the public sector in particular, unions have allowed a channel to uncover waste, fraud and abuse in contracting practices, where electeds or employers made bad agreements with private companies to offer services. Whistleblower protections also came from unions and have a tremendous benefit to the public.

Minorities are treated differently because the American culture has painted them as criminals, thugs, rapists, etc. According to Dr. Eberhardt, black men are equated with danger, threat, aggression, and crime.

I think the public reaction was somewhat overblown in that it resulted in protests and expanded to other Starbucks locations.  I think the two individuals involved actually handled the situation very well given what they were put through by the police.. I agree that the media does often misrepresent the true facts which makes it hard to determine what really transpired in the situation. It is very difficult to get an unbiased, balanced view from much of the media. Both the left and right views slant the news to further their viewpoint.. I think the response to the situation was ultimately handled well by the individuals and has resulted in Starbucks taking an active role in helping to educate its employees.  . Yes, we do agree!  But, I don't agree that the mainstream media predominantly presents a left view of situations.  I think it's important in viewing any of the news be it mainstream or not, with an open mind and try and form your own opinion or, better yet, view both sides and then form your opinion.. If the police had used a racial slur or an offensive tag against a minority employee from Starbucks, I think the action taken should be different because the police are in a much different position both of authority and visibility, and a comment or slur against someone can have far reaching ramifications on the community and how they are viewed within their community.",6.83333333333333,5.94444444444444,7,2,3,4.66666666666667,5,4,"High","High","High","High"

The death penalty is antiquated in today's criminal justice framework.  The first part is:  What is the purpose?  In the end the argument is that is makes people, ""feel good.""  The supposition is not supported by the matrix of sentencing for a crime.  Would one decide not to kill because some else was put to death?  No.  Does it rehabilitate?  No.  It is punishment only.  Does the framework of punishment conform to one's ideals?  It does not and it should not.  . While your position is well thought-out, it does not answer the following question: Would does it benefit?  Death is finite and it cannot be undone.  The decision to put to death does not benefit anyone other than potentially the family of the victim(s).  However, that is a false belief because the family still lost their love one(s) and their like continues on.   There is no cost saving either given the appellate process. . No, my ideals are not considered-I could (or my family) could (or were) victims of a serious crime.  I could ask the same question.   It is a system that no other first world country considers because it is no longer an important consideration in the criminal justice process.  While I absolutely agree that some defendants are beyond rehabilitation, the appropriate remedy is not death. . Cost is not the only matrix to consider.  There are more components.  It is to the core of who we are (or should be) as people.  Does death for a significant crime outweigh the dangers of:  (1) being 100% sure we are correct that the person committed the crime  (2) Who is making the decision to put to death-a jury of one's peers? and (3) Who is the arbiter of death? . I agree that life is messy and complicated, but that is not persuasive enough.   There is more here.  The criminal justice system will always be ""messy"" because those that are making the decisions are not perfect.  It is the best system, but a fallible system.

A healthy union environment can foster productive, collaborative labor-management relationships. Unions provide a voice and protection to employees in the workplace and accountability to decision makers.  Unions work to fight corporate control which impacts funding for vital services required for a healthy, functioning society. They are seen as a threat because they balance power.. I agree there are instances of adversarial relationships between union members and management, but I would argue that those exist even in non-organized work sites. It is in no ones best interest to put any employer in a difficult financial position - a union contract doesn't benefit anyone if there is not work or a job for it to cover. I appreciate you also support their right to collectively bargain terms and conditions of employment.  Some feel that because tax dollars are involved they are somehow less worthy or the right to a voice.. It usually involves intentionally setting up formal labor management meetings, with ground rules and norms of behavior to follow.  This allows for a safe environment to discuss issues and concerns and attempt to problem solve instead of gripe. They tend to lower the number of grievances filed. Bargaining topics are off limits, but management can get some important feedback on where employee moral is at and what can be done to improve it if they are willing to listen. Same goes for the employees, they feel more engaged if they feel they are being kept in the loop with information and potential changes the employer may be considering.  But there will always be individuals who use the union as an excuse for bad behavior - fortunately they are the exception not the rule.. Agreed, good union advocates and involved union members don't lose sight that there is often an economic impact to every decision that is made, or any contract benefit they receive. It should be an exercise in prioritization, versus a Christmas wish list. It is true that public sector jobs typically pay less, because of the funding mechanisms.  That is why other benefits such as pensions and health care become critical, as a way to compensate. It is unfortunate that the stereotypes and demonization of public sector workers continues when reality is most work very hard at the jobs they are hired to do.. Absolutely. It is all about relationships. If you can be open and honest with one another it makes the difficult conversations and decisions easier to manage. Taking the emotion out of it is critical, but often hard to do when people feel threatened (both employees, employers and the elected officials who typically oversee budgets and negotiation processes).  A good employer can use the union and the contract to its advantage, it doesn't mean you have to be stuck with problem employees - if you follow the rules and make sure they have due process most would weed themselves out!

Unions improve these items for both members and nonmembers. Unions reduce the pay disparity between gender and people of color. . I agree unions have a role to play in society, much like the ecosystem David King described. It's important that both employers and workers be held accountable and collective bargaining enables that. There are many competing pressures placed on both unions and employers, but working collaboratively will ensure the agreement is sustainable. . I believe in balance, shared accountability and mutual respect. In my experience, unions and management both take their roles seriously. Conflict or impasse results when unreasonable demands are made. When the needs of the whole are considered, and not just one side, a more productive and palatable agreement is reached. . Yes! Communication and clarity are key! Sometimes easier said than done, but always crucial to any success. Building trust is essential to forming an effective working relationship and collective bargaining agreement. When management and unions collaborate, the public benefits from better services that improve the quality of life for people in the community.. I'm pleased we were able to reach agreement so quickly!

Regardless of which side of  politics you follow; it is difficult to reconcile the predominant left view in the mainstream media. The views of the media have heavily influenced relationships with police and community (on both sides) without fairly representing the views of the community. Using an interview with a person does not represent the views of a majority. . Ok, I get what you mean now - the corrective action taken by Starbucks. If the police had used a racial slur or an offensive tag against a minority employee from Starbucks, would you accept the actions taken by police to ""resolve"" the issue by educating the police officers? It's not strictly the same I know, but I think the response by police was appropriate to voice their protest. . I knew we agreed :) It is important to get all views and form your opinion. But - if the news sources you listen to are preaching the same views this is what contributes to the media influence over topics. People are habitual and will not change news channels to seek a balanced view - they will normally stick with what they know.

For example, at my company recently, the Union executed a work slowdown and filed grievances for perceived changes in working conditions, which were actually management enforcing, verbatim, elements of the current bargaining unit contract.  In our state, these workers are subject to a mutual gains structure and while they cannot strike as a result, neither can management unilaterally enforce elements of the contract, or an entire new contract if negotiated.  This is a significant disruption on the work.. I agree that unions are entitled to a voice in how their work environment is structured, but it should be an equal voice with management, not tilted in their favor.  Union members will sometimes refuse to work as the contract is written, or interpret the contract language in a way different than management.  If they are unwilling to work with management a work stoppage or significant economic impact can result.  In addition, sometimes politics within the unit are diverse and management struggles to responsibly meet the needs of the unit sub groups - to the detriment of all.. Your comments are valid only when the Union feels some ownership in the success of the enterprise, even if short term impacts to them.  While these issues can be addressed through HR processes, the underlying grievance process adds additional management burden and at times seems to be purposefully used to stall or delay reasonable action.  I acknowledge management shared responsibility to establish a working environment where all groups feel a part of the team and are motivated to support organizational success, but when the union en masse is resistive to change, even when it is to the economic benefit of the company as a whole - the entire organization suffers.. I agree with your comments and efforts have been made to provide broad based education on current organizational challenges.  I am referring to electric power industry, which is under some strain to reduce costs.  Management personnel have participated in this burden (including low skilled, low pay non-union employees) but to date the union has been unwilling to consider even holding compensation level or at an inflation adjusted rate.  They believe the rest of the organization will pay the price of their job protection and compensation packages.. Again, I agree wholeheartedly with your statements.  It is fair to say that management has not delivered an understandable message on the need for change, and that the represented staff (about 35% of the organization) is lacking some trust in management that contributes to their position.  Still, this dialog is a two way street and after years of mediation a new contract was signed that resulted in disproportionate union compensation, requiring dismissal of valued management staff to pay for the changes  -- staff as equally important as the bargaining unit personnel.",5.22222222222222,4.55555555555556,5.77777777777778,7,4,5,5.66666666666667,5,"High","Low","Low","High"

I will definitely suggest this approach to the management team colleagues responsible for working with our union. We actually had an instance where union employees were making public comments and gripes about management during Council meetings, which of course exacerbated lack of trust and collaboration.

Police must address their unconscious bias, and truly biased police officers must be fired.  The minority community, must work with police to develop trust so that shooting are viewed from a legal stand point and not a racial standpoint.  These conversations, if held honestly, should bridge that gap between reality and perception.. No argument here, I feel that the main barriers to addressing this issue, is the minority community believing the police always get it wrong and the police believe they never get it wrong.  Police and minorities both need to hold themselves and each other accountable to address this issue effectively.. I agree with that.

They serve an important function in a democratic society.  They represent the will of an organized group of people, and in collective power can influence outcomes for the betterment of their individual members - and also the society they serve. Such unions came into existence based on need; if left to pure market forces, industrialists and businesses took advantage of individual workers' rights and abilities, and only in unionizing were they respected in the end. . All good points. Some unions have, indeed, come to represent their own self interests, it seems.  And I also agree that people should not be forced to join one if they choose not to.  The problems come when a non-member wants to or gets to benefit from the contracts that that union has gained for the entire profession - how should that be handled? And what should be done with unions who have gained too much influence - who regulates them and how? The answers aren't so simple, of course. . Agreed. When unions act as lobbying groups, in some ways they are doing exactly what their members want them to do - advocacy. Lobbyists by design are supposed to influence legislators; the question is at what level or by what measure does that influence become ""undue""? Elected officials absolutely have a part in this as well - especially when money and votes are exchanged for support.  Totally agree that this is flawed, but very American in practice. . I think that's why some states are ""right to work"" states and others are not.  The history and culture of each state, as well as the prevailing politics, has resulted in different rules about public sector unions even being able to exist on a state-by-state basis.  That means federal oversight or regulation may be needed if the majority thinks public sector unions need to be ""reigned in,"" but that position is biased toward conservative ends of the political system, so any solutions toward that end would be considered suspect by those on the left, and certainly the unions themselves.  In the end, I think unions are a dying breed anyway - at least in our time and market forces. . The unintended consequences of public sector unions are real issues for state governments.  And the purpose for their existence are also important.  There are coordinating values at play here and I think they can be worked on in tandem.  If we start isolating issues without context, or working on solutions without acknowledging ripple effects of the solutions themselves, then we become part of the problem. The things you mention are important.  I wonder if we could get to a place where the unions themselves are responsible for being a part of the solution.

While I understand that the death penalty can help to bring closure for families, life in prison can do the same.  In some states, the method of administering death is also less than humane.. I agree that the death penalty helps to bring closure for families but feel there are other ways to also do the same.  I agree that crimes subject to the death penalty are often horrible.  However, given the financial limitations, long process with appeals, and potential cases of mistaken identity, plus the reinforcement of killing, that the death penalty is not something that our society should support.  Life in prison is also a just punishment.. While you may feel that killing is condoned by government, the question is should it be?  I agree that modern technology makes cases of mistaken identity less likely in the future.  However, the financial facts about the death penalty remain.  While both life in prison and the death penalty both have a lot of appeals, the cost of life in prison is less than the death penalty.  The costs are not even close to the same.

The death penalty is important for the families of crime victims to know that justice will be served and for the community that demands justice.  Some crimes are so horrible, for example the rape and murder of a child they demand death.. While wrongful convictions in the past are undeniable, the fact of the lengthy appeals and the use of new DNA and other technologies makes all of us more secure in death verdicts than ever before.  People sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole also have lengthy appeals, and are just as costly to the system.  The fact that some states use inhumane methods of administering the death penalty does not mean that it can't be done humanely.  Finally, government killing is condoned in war, in police actions when in lawful defense of others,. While life in prison is a just punishment for some.  There can be no closure, no statement by a community that we hold someone accountable in the ultimate way, other than with the death penalty.  The financial limitations are also a construct of the death penalty opposition whose strategy is to make the process long, drawn out and expensive - and then point to that fact as a reason to eliminate the death penalty.  If eliminated, would that same strategy not also be used for life without possibility of parole (a slow death penalty)?. I think that killing in a war like against the Nazis in WWII or in the former Yugoslavia to prevent ethnic cleansing should be justifiable.  As is killing of a suspect by a police officer when that suspect is threatening the life of another person for example.  That state is the state killing, and the death penalty is a version of that same thing.  The state is killing someone as a punishment for the most heinous of offenses.  You are right that the costs for the death penalty are high because of the lengthy appeals process, but I sincerely wonder if we would not see the same in Life without parole sentences,. I think that the prison reform movement that has changed life sentences in California to sentences that are parole eligible earlier, and to change the sentences of people convicted of life without possibility of parole to parole eligible has undermined the closure that life sentences give.  The community cannot trust that someone sentenced to life will actually serve a life sentence.  That fact, and from the advocacy of victims family groups who state that they cannot get closure without the death penalty in some instances makes me feel that closure in some cases can only be achieved with capital punishment.",5.55555555555556,4.44444444444444,6.27777777777778,2,4,4,4.66666666666667,5,"Low","Low","High","Low"

Discovery is the area most abused by DA staffs so I would first like to see discovery rules changed. ",225,"G9","I DO NOT believe that the death penalty should be abolished in all US states.  These are the following reasons why I think so:  1. There are some crimes heinous enough that inflict large scale destruction that simply warrant a death penalty e.g. acts of terrorism, mass murders etc. It is important to allow for the death penalty in order to send a message as a deterrent for future such criminals  2. Also, it is expensive to house and care for these criminals forever as well and should not be borne by the state. . Yes exactly. Incarceration without the death penalty is an expensive  burden and the legal, judicial and other costs take away from other areas of need in society.   There are some individuals who are deemed harmful enough that there is no rehabilitation that can be considered possible.   What are your thoughts on the partial abolishing of the death penalty?. Yes we do. That is a legitimate concern since there have been cases that have been revealed to be innocent through DNA testing or otherwise. In a lot of situations, these are examples from the time where DNA testing and scientific rigor was not effectively applied due to lack of scientific means at the time.   Hopefully, there are more resources and newer, more accurate technology that will minimize greatly, if not totally eliminate these errors and thus help assuage your concerns. As for errors, it is important to allow due process and a fair / just one in order to ensure that no one innocent finds themselves behind bars and on death row. . That's a fair point. Thank you.   What would be the criteria that defines serious crime and how would we be able to hold attorneys to a higher standard as well as what kind of rules of evidence changes do you envision?. I can see your point. I am supportive of having DA staff prohibited from running for a period of time after the political office as well in order to ensure its not a publicity stunt.

Police and minorities both need to hold themselves and each other accountable to address this issue effectively.. I agree with that.  Understanding cultural differences is important for our police departments and officers and it is just as important for the community to understand the police culture and thought process.  What many people see as harmless movement can easily be misinterpreted by a police officer as a physical, if not deadly, threat.  Honest, thorough reviews of the investiagtie process would also help build transparecney and hopefully more trust.. I agree, the problem I see if that racial profiling is too difficult to prove or disprove,  it speaks, most of the time, to the subjective mind of the officer instead of the objective.  Officer can easily cover their subjective mind with objective facts and or reasons, many times, without lying or exceeding their constitutional boundaries.  I think that is why it is so sensitive.  It rarely can be proven or disproved which frustrates both groups.",325,"G1","Relationships between police and minority members of the community matter. Some people in the minority community have been suspects of crimes because of profiling.   What people are acknowledging publicly right now is that both police officers and members of the community need to co-exist respectfully and that is not the case right now. It matters that everyone can exist in this world equally. It's a conversation that we need to be willing to have.. Statistics about other issues around high death tolls matter, but does not mean we can't have conversations about police officers and members of minority communities being suspects of crime as well. The movement is about people acknowledging issues exist and a willingness to work towards a better relationship among people in our communities. Police and minority community relations are not perfect and improvement can definitely be made.. Absolutely. This needs to be a shared mission between members of a police department and members of the community. Even people who aren't involved in a disagreement with both; what can teachers be doing to help bridge gaps? What can leaders in churches to do help bridge gaps? It needs to be everyone working towards a better relationship to have the outcome of safer communities where all people feel like they can rely on the police for help in times of need.  . Yes. There needs to be shared ownership of both officers and members of the community about when they're wrong. And consequences to those situations. So if a member of the police does profile someone because of their race, they need to be held accountable. And if members of the community do lie about the way a situation was handled by police, they need to be held accountable, too. We need to be able to call people out when they are wrong because nobody should be above the law. Building bridges among the two communities is key. . Yes. That's why I believe citizen academies are also helpful as an opportunity to see what it's like to be in an officer's shoes. Similarly, officers need to sit down at the table and understand the cultural differences for many people in minority communities. Ex: In some south american countries, all officers are corrupt and speaking against government can get you killed by police. We need to understand that people come from different places and relationships and built around the cultural norms that some people have seen with friends/family or have experienced first hand.   Thorough reviews of the investigative process would definitively be an opportunity for people to understand the perspective of officers.

I do agree that they serve a purpose, but some unions have become powerful well funded lobbying groups that exert undue influence on legislators.

Its a great point that I don't have an answer for in the moment, who would regulate them?  And how do we define how big is too big and how much influence is too much or too little.. Yes, true.  Some of the largest long term financial pension issues in my state, and in my opinion, are the result of overzealous and rich benefits lobbied for by public safety unions.  We continue to grapple with how to address inter-generational equity and viability of the pension system.  So I guess I see a problem, but don't know how to fix it.  I think it highlights the importance of a continued and candid discussion.. You are probably right in that they may be a dying breed.

I return to my argument that the problem often lies with the negotiating team from the municipality's side of the table.  If the municipality negotiates a bad deal or one that produces an unsustainable financial outcome the union holds a level of culpability , but its the City 's responsibility to negotiate fair and sustainable deals for the citizens.. I believe you can strongly disagree with complex issues and unions that are formed in either party dominated municipality are still trying to get the best deal for their employees.  The question is who has the better negotiating team.  Both parties must be wiling to negotiate based upon the best outcome for either constituents , but also be willing to take the sustainability of their deal into account.  A financially hobbled municipality cannot afford to pay anyone.. Unfortunately, elected officials often are willing to make bad decisions based upon the priorities of  their financial supporters.  If an elected votes for a deal that hobbles the City's ability to be financially sustainable that information needs to be brought out by the media or during the election process and the voters decide if that person is an asset to the municipality.   Elected officials are the stewards of public funds and they msut be held accountavle,.. The ask for more is often the problem.  The municipality must be willing to give when available, but take or hold when required as well.  No one wants  a strike, but the City has to maintain its financial viability also.  The municipalities purse must be the priority in this situation.",5.16666666666667,4.66666666666667,6.11111111111111,2,4,4.33333333333333,5.33333333333333,4,"Low","Low","Low","High"

Social Media, open government, and Sunshine rules prevent labor from being abused by management.  Management, for the most part, are promoted to their position from labor, so they know what it is like to be in labor's shoes.  They understand both the needs and the rules required to ensure Labor is fairly treated.  In the public sector especially, the good of the whole can only be realized when Labor's needs are taken account for. . Representation is important, but the relationship between labor and management doesn't need to be filtered by union representation.  Labor's needs and desires are taken into account by management and is typically in the public domain, making it difficult, although not impossible, for labor to be abused or taken advantage of.  All it would take is for labor disagreements to make into the public domain to ensure that all parties are treated equitable.  Labor's needs are absolutely integral to good government.  We are all in this together.. I can't dispute that there may be bad managers, just like there may be bad employees, but the needs of labor are absolutely important to good management.  The transparency of today's social media environment should eliminate the ability for a bad manager to take advantage of labor.  It appears in most cases, both labor and management look to other localities or similar entities to determine if wants or needs are typical or out of the norm.  If it appears to be standard, both sides can easily coalesce! . I concur that all disagreements don't make it into the public domain.  However, all it would take for someone who is disadvantaged or taken advantage of is to take it to the media or get a Facebook following to put pressure on management to ensure they do the right thing.  However, it appears in most cases that managers and labor's goals and desires are common and that the common ground is where we can settle.  It is important for all sides to work together. . It appears that similar work environments, similar cost of living, and other measures in regions or like type organizations can set the standard that can be shared.  An organization that does not have a workforce that feels valued and a part of the team is not as productive nor effective.  It is in management's best interest to ensure that the workforce is properly compensated and properly equipped to do their job.  The entire organization requires this and that is management's responsibility.    ",5.61111111111111,4.61111111111111,6.22222222222222,6,3,4.33333333333333,6.33333333333333,4,"Low","Low","High","Low"

I am committed to my faith in following the 10 commandments and Thou Shall Not kill is one of them.  Further, I don't think it is humane to ask another human being or public servant to conduct the death penalty.  There are other forms of punishment far greater than death that I feel are more appropriate for those who commit the most heinous of crimes, which could be explored given more time.  The death penalty also could result in innocent people being put on death row innocently.  . Death penalty in my opinion is not the worst of punishment.  I agree that someone who commits the most severe of crimes deserves the most severe of punishment but it is much easier to put all criminals in a cage together and let them kill themselves in my opinion.  There are those that are punished with the death penalty that are innocent as well.  . As a Christian, I believe in the New Testament and the values of Christ such as forgiveness and love.  Love for all persons.  God loves and forgives every child he brings to this world, and because we are not the creator nor he that knows all things, we cannot judge.  In the event the court decides that someone has committed such a crime that they deserve the worst of punishment, I do not believe that Death is the worst of punishment as a Christian.  Not everyone is given a full opportunity to receive justice in the US, thus a definitive Death penalty has a great amount of holes in how those who are given the death penalty and how often it is used among some races more than other.  . I agree with you that our justice system needs significant reform!  And I like that you continue to stress that the death penalty be used for situations where without a doubt the person is guilty.  I just strongly believe that there are punishments for those who truly commit the worst of crimes to be given more appropriate sentences.   In a system where people are not innocent until proven guilty, I think it is very hard to make a determination of who is truly guilty of crimes in some instances.  It is not as black and white and easy to determine as what people may think.. I think that the act of killing, either it being done by our justice system or by someone who thinks they are doing a just deed regardless of the law is wrong.

There is no method that is consistent and effective enough to be considered humane.  2. While it is expensive to keep people alive, people have a fundamental right to repent and reform. Killing them deprives them of this right.  . I would be interested in seeing any statistics that show that the death penalty is effective at deterring crimes punishable by the death penalty. I would be surprised if the data showed that. For example are there fewer murders in states with the death penalty available for murder.   I find the rarity of its use immaterial to the question. . Interesting. Were there no other negotiating tools to be used in the case? There are so many other options besides a death penalty. I can think of lots of options that would be considered ""cruel and unusual"". Funny that death is not considered too cruel.   Of course the act a crime was inherently inhumane, but that does not give us the right to also act inhumanely. . I'm not entirely clear on what you mean by ""Raising the level of the crime"". If you mean that fewer types of crimes should deserve the death penalty, that would be a step in the right direction in my mind. In the end I don't see data that suggests that penalties, even as severe as death in fact prevent crime. . It sounds like a main reason to keep the death penalty is as a form of ""justice"".

The death penalty is a deterrent to violent crime, such as murder. These people have been tried and convicted by a jury of their peers so they have been deemed guilty of the crime. This is a way to show criminals that they will receive just punishment for their crime. Also, it allows families to have closure - to see just punishment for what has been done to their loved ones. Those convicted have a right to counsel and get help but when found guilty, the punishment must fit the crime. . Death penalty should be retained for more than terrorist attacks and school shootings. It should be retained for murder. How can you define that it's appropriate only in certain types of murders but others don't deserve it. Yes, guns are easy to access, but murder can be with bare hands. For other offenses the punishment should fit the crime. . why should one get a 2nd chance for murder? We don't want ""rehabilitated"" murderers roaming our streets. These are violent criminals that don't belong on our streets. Once you commit a crime, you are more likely to commit another crime.  Would you trust a murderer with your family members? We give too many 2nd chances and there is a reason that penalties increase for repeat offenders - because crimes keep happening and are being committed by the same people over and over again. . The bottom line is that people are convicted based on a jury of their peers - they have ample opportunity to present the facts are are presumed innocent until proven guilty. They have the right to be represented by an attorney and even really great law firms today offer pro bono work so they can receive quality representation. yes, facts should be carefully considered. But that is the purpose of a trial - for the facts to come out and be considered. . Today's advances in criminal proceedings with DNA and more ensure that the facts are presented up front. It's very different than days past when more was left open. This is how we are catching and convicting criminals today - the evidence is clear and more absolute than ever before.

The Death penalty does not work as a deterant for those who commit crimes and it is more expensive then putting people in jail.   . You make a valid point and I struggled with using your  analysis as my answer as well.   There are those who can never be rehabilitated and also those who commit crimes so heinous that they should suffer the most extreme punishment.   I came down on the otherside, because, who should judge that line of who should be put to death and who should not.  . II used the cost factor, because for many years that was a reason given.   As far as a deterent, I do not believe people that commit crimes that rise to this level give a thought as to their punishment.  I do think that an advanced society should be using other methods of punishment.  . As you might be able to tell, I struggle with this issue for a very select group and tend to agree with many of your points, but sparing someone's live would always be preferable to me.  Using the criminal as a test subject while in jail might be a potential way to help deter future crimes.  . So, you would put all criminal in the same category?

Pension liabilities are out of control primarily because union leader decisions are uninformed and uneducated.  Many organization's management leaders are indeed being more receptive to contract employee issues, lending union leadership irrelevant.  Union dues are excessive and union rules are outdated.  Unions have many elected officials in their pocket.. I submit that the safe and efficient delivery of services have nothing to do with unions or their existence.  Most organizations ensure adequate and relevant training and safety measures are applied to the delivery of services.  There are adequate laws on the books to ensure the safety and non-explotation of workers.  Unions were relevant at one time, now they are obsolete. . Easy to say.  However, the trick is implementing these corrective measures without a work stoppage by labor.   Work rules, threats of strikes and timid elected officials stop improvements that could be made.   Patronage jobs would occur with or without unions.  In fact, unions may perpetuate patronage.. The lack of minimum wage increases have more to do with conservative politics, not the advocacy of unions.  Most organizations are going to a merit or ""pay for performance"" structure.  Unions hate that and prefer that everyone get moved up the pay scale regardless of performance.  I would be a supporter of unions if they agreed to pay for performance.  The rising tides have more to do with under-performing union workers getting increases versus management folks piggybacking on union wage increases.. There is more fighting in union shops than you can shake a stick at.  The idea of advocating for unions because they build loyalty and create a teamwork approach to the delivery of services is laughable.

Many minority and low-income individuals are the predominate demographic in prison.  The death penalty is for the worst offenders but catches innocents as well therefore should be abolished.. I hear that you have reservations about the frequency of use of this penalty, and using the system sparingly can be a valiant goal, however its a system designed to be unfair to many who are proven innocent based on evidence that may have been restricted from being used in exonerating their case.  Given how many people have been proven innocent suggests a sparingly used system doesn't work well.. We seem to have some common ground around this issue--innocent people get caught into the death penalty system when DNA and other methods prove their innocence. I agree.  One of the reasons I'm against the death penalty is because we spend more money on housing incarcerated individuals than educating our children.  Another solution is to allocated funds to programs that address the issues that lead to individuals committing crimes.. In a judicial system that values fairness and justice, there is inherent injustice the system.

Dealing with them is uncomfortable and placing the burden of overcoming the hurdle predominantly on one group may seem unfair to that group, but the experiences of those without as much power cannot be disregarded, otherwise, the feeling is that they are not taken seriously and the gap between groups continues to grow with both groups simply disregarding the other's viewpoints.  There is a lot of work to do, but we can't begin on the work if one groups feelings are minimized.. I agree with you.  How do we begin, then?  I think it is by acknowledging that there is a problem.  I do not think the problem is overblown.  If the problem is not as great as people say it is, then it is not as urgent to solve it.  Any instance of unnecessary police violence is unacceptable to our community; it is important to give this problem the weight it deserves.",430,"H41","I believe there have been a misrepresentation of the depth in which this occurs.  Although confrontations have taken place between police and minority suspects, this is a small fraction of interaction police have with the community each day.   . I agree, and feel one way to reduce this is for the police to take every contact as an opportunity to showcase the good in which they do, and take responsibility for he actual negative action that has occur,to help increase the trust and transparency of their profession. Also be mindful of the perception others have  may have his their reality. . And once again I agree.  Public servants of all walks must take ownership for their failures and work to reduce the negative perceptions and realities that occur, being ever mindful of the experiences and realities of others. It is important to work together and not increase the issues through divisiveness. . Absolutely,  the police need to be aware of their own individual biases and ensure they are not getting in the way of treating others differently.  The police have an extremely powerful position and responsibility  in our society, and have a monopoly on the service within their given jurisdictions.  therefore this responsibility to do the right thing is even grater. . i also agree that training and partnerships with the community in which they serve are a vital piece of success.  the more inclusive you are with a community the more effective  the police can be.   In fact without the voluntary support and trust of a community, the police can never reach their fullest potential at service the community or understanding when they are where they are succeeding or more importantly missing the mark.

Training, safety and continuity of service delivery is the goal, while avoiding the explotation of the workers. Limits to activites such as striking when it endangers public health are key to supporting the public even as supporting worker rights.. While there is some merit to your position, there are other issues to be concerned with. Public employee Unions exist to avoid 'patronage jobs and unqualified folks recieving no-show jobs. Issues such as pension plans can be resolved via increased payroll contributions and public contributions, as well as considering moving to systems such as a 'defined benefit plan, or by moving a workforce into the social security system.. Workers in the private secotr often enjoy the benefits of 'rising tides', the potential for profit sharing or stock option rewards. Public sector jobs are often disdanded by the public, althought the workers are committed to their jobs. Unions have the effect of bringing up wages for those in the private sector even as those groups may not have union representation because of the competitiveness of better paying jobs. Additonally, Workers are again being exploited on a regula basis, look at the lack of increase to minimum wages. Building loyality and a team-work approach to the delivery of services requires a unity of spirit among the workforce, abuses regarding 'office favoritism and wages being assigned by 'favor' as opposed to merit is common when there are not defined and accepted tiers of labor and wages. important benefits such as overtime or health insurance are often stripped from workers when they must work toward these benefits as sole individuals. Unions and management in the public sector often work very well together, union members pay taxes too, and understand budget constraints. I would agree with the goal of rewarding supieror work, and advancing those employees. I believe that the goal should be fair treatment of workers, and fair return of value for the money spent. Unions often can be involved to increase product quality and productivity iof they are treated as equals at the table.",2.55555555555556,3.44444444444444,4.5,2,3,4,4.66666666666667,4,"High","Low","Low","High"
